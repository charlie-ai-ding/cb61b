":"It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores... ...instead ofjust downloading comics digitally. It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here... ...is the only chance their mom has to go to the basement and change their sheets. [ALL CHUCKLE] Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay. WeIl, what do you think of new comic book night? Magic, huh? Sheldon, l'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den... ...or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o. A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art... ...a medium that dates back 1 7,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux... ...and B, you play the harp, Iike that's cool. Can I heIp you find anything? A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can't be used as a flotation device. Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. A couple of them have big boobs. The new WarIords of Ka'a expansion pack is out. A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters... ...slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid. They're not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to heIl? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation? \"Wild West and Witches.\" What kind of loser cares about a showdown... ...between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North? Heh. A total loser. Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand. WeIl, ho-- hold on. Uh, what if the wizard casts a helmet-of-confusion spell... ...on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat? What? Please. This is Billy the Kid we're talking about. The wizard would get shot before he could get out the words: \"What the hell is BilIy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?\" Leonard, ahem... [ALL CHUCKLE] Are you interested in Amy? WeIl, I mean, she didn't look through me... ...with soul-sucking, ball-shriveIing hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if l could ask her out? Sure, I guess. Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the white Wizard? [CHUCKLES] If I tell you that, I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have... ...for the magical, rootin'-tootin Iow price of 24.95. -I'll take one. -Mm. Make it two. I hate all of you and myself. Three. I'll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel. Hey, can l talk to you about something? It's a little awkward. I know what this is about. Given the professional standstiIl you're at... ...you're wondering if this is the appropriate time... ...to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities. Perhaps, history. One of the advantages of teaching history... ...is that you don't have to create things. You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened... ...and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that. Yeah, that's not it. Stuart's kind of interested in Amy. WeIl, of course, he is. She's very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14... ...she severed the webbing between her own toes? No. Uh.... He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out. WeIl, I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I mean, I don't own Amy. You can't own a person. At least, not since.... 1 863. President Lincoln freed the.... The slaves. Come on, Leonard, if you're gonna teach history... ...these are the kind of facts you'll have to know. You know what? Never mind. I'm gonna telI him it's okay to ask her out. The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart... ...an impoverished peddler of picture books... ...would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler... ...a noted neurobiologist... ...capable of performing surgery on her own feet... ...with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia. AIl right, but for the record... ...I checked in with you to see how you'd feeI about it. Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand... ...what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist. I am not washed-up. Oh, Leonard. Lots of people Iove you and want to heIp you... ...but they can't until you admit the problem. Ugh. well, ladies, we killed the bottle. -I had half a glass. -I didn't have any. Okay, don't judge me. So, what do you wanna do? Go to the movies, go dancing... ...lay down for a little bit? Ahem. Or we play... ...Travel Twister. Amy, really? Twister? Excuse me, l've passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And l'm sure it's a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I'm shirts. Called it. [PHONE BUZZES] I'm too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, mom. Hey, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me... ...and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, l have peach schnapps. Thank God. -Guys, something happened. -What's wrong? I think a boy likes me. \"Hi. lt's Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime. It's okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants l need to start taking Zoloft.\" Amy, you little vixen. Just working it under alI those layers of wool and polyester. What are you gonna do? Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend? Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. -So do you like Stuart? -I don't know. He's nice. He's funny. He has the sallow-drawn countenance... ...associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That's kind of hot. Look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now. If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around? Yeah, l guess they're not engaged Iike me and Howie. For what it's worth, engaged people can Iook around too. Lot of options out there. Where's Stuart? [SNICKERS] Out. -Who are you? -I'm Dale. He left me in charge. -Really? -Yeah. I don't get it either. I wanna return this Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack. Sorry, I don't do returns. They're hard. Sure, sure. -Uh, when will Stuart be back? -I don't know. He went out for coffee. With a girl. [CHUCKLES] Ah. I guess I was wrong. You okay? Am l okay? Leonard, I'm on a lifeIong trajectory... ...that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me. AIl four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction... ...and my bowel movements run Iike a German train schedule. Am l okay? I'm okay too. Wild Bill Witchcock. A tribe of Abra-Comanches. Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I'm very disappointed in you, cowpokes. We're pIaying our inaugural round of Wild West and witches... ...and I'm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. Patooie. We're not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. lt looks ridicuIous. And l suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous too? HOWARD & LEONARD: Yeah. RAJESH: Incredibly so. Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack... ...and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat? HOWARD & LEONARD: Yeah. RAJESH: Incredibly so. AIl right, fine. Let's just play. We should go easy on him. Amy's out with Stuart tonight. Wait a minute. Are you telling me... ...that Sheldon's patented blend of condescension and no sex... ...isn't enough to hold on to a woman? Cluck. Cluck. Cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game... ...set in a magical frontier town? Sorry. Creepy Tepee. Annie Ogly. Hocus Pocus Pocahontas. And may l point out, it is the three of you... ...who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here. [SPURS CLANGlNG] -It's you. -You are. Hey, guys, check it out. The deIuxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack... ...in the signed and numbered collector's tin. Come on, no. We just bought the regular pack. Ooh. A sheriff's badge. Ha, ha. Yeah, it's also a wand. With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this? I'm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything. You gotta be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook? -I thought you didn't like Facebook. -Don't be silly. I'm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact. PIease. You're looking at Facebook to find out how their date went. Really? You think I care if a man... ...what, \"Shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady\"? -You're so full of it. -You're free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali. You unfriended me? SeriousIy? Oh, yeah. Now he's gonna miss all those great updates like: \"l can't believe l waited this Iong... [lN lNDlAN ACCENT] ...to make my own potpourri.\" Ha, ha. Why don't you acknowledge you have feelings for Amy... ...and don't want her going out with other men? And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter. Here's a radical thought. Go old school. Challenge Stuart to a fight. Nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys... ...swatting at each other with their eyes closed. And unfriend Howard Wolowitz. That's all of us. Can l use the laptop? -Why? -I have to buy that stupid collector's tin. PENNY: Who do we Iove? -Penny. HelIo, Sheldon. Come on in. -Thank you. -What's up? I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me. I'm sorry, what? A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight. [MlCROWAVE BEEPS] Ugh, God, are you trying to make Amy jealous? No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight. Okay, listen to me. PIaying games is not gonna help get Amy back. I am not trying to get her back. But out of curiosity, what is a way? AIl right, honey, Iet me tell you a story. There was a guy l Iiked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else and l always regretted it. Do you see where l'm going with this? -I believe l do. -Hmm. I'm the guy. You're not the guy. Are you sure? That wouId explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment... ...that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me... ...the way you call me sweetie all the time. -I call everyone sweetie. -You tramp. Ugh. Look, Sheldon, alI I'm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy. Strap on a pair? Wait. Of what, skates? Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy. [DRAMATIC STRlNG MUSlC PLAYlNG ON FILM] If you're bored, you can go. I understand. No, I'm having a nice time. [SCOFFS] Don't patronize me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. -Hi, Stuart. -Hi, Sheldon. Pardon me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [SHELDON SlGHS] Sheldon, what are you doing here? The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater... ...with a character like Stuart is repellent. -No offense, Stuart. -None taken. AIthough repellent is kind of a strong word. I'm sorry this causes you discomfort... ...but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship... ...I can put myself in any repellent situation I want. -Um.... Again-- -Stuart, pIease, you're being rude. Anything else? I believe l would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship. I'm listening. With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever... ...physical or otherwise... ...I would not object to us no longer characterizing you... ...as \"not my girlfriend.\" Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative. You're being impossible. Hi, Stuart. Fine. Amy... ...wilI you be my girlfriend? -Yes. -WeIl, that's enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here's a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy... ...this was nice. Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door. Oh, you're welcome. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] SHELDON: Amy? Amy? Amy? Let's wrap things up out there. -Um.... Good night, Stuart. -Good night. SHELDON: Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night. How did you get into my apartment? Wow. ls that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you're my girIfriend? Good thing l drew this up. What's that? I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies... ...the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper... ...here and after known as \"the boyfriend\"... ...and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as \"the girlfriend.\" It's so romantic. Mutual indemnification always is. Why don't you start perusing whiIe l set up my notary stamp. \"Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only aIlowed under the following circumstances. A, either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B, either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C, moral support during flu shots.\" -Seems a bit restrictive. -Yeah, well, feel free to retain a lawyer. Penny, l said, \"Right hand, red.\" Yeah, l heard you. l got red. Ahem. Bernadette... ...left foot, yellow. [BERNADETTE GRUNTS] We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] SHELDON: Penny? Amy? Bernadette? That's my boyfriend. It's open. I got a splinter. What do you want me to do about it? Relationship Agreement Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it. I should've gotten a lawyer. Looks like it's just us playing. [PENNY SNORlNG] Penny? -Penny, we're out of wine. -You should probably drive. [English - US - SDH]"}
