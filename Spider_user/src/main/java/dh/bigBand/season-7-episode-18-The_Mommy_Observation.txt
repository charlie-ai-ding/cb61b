":"Previously on This Is Us... KEVIN: All your children you love equally, right? - I do love all my children equally. - Yeah, I'm sure that you do. Just admit that you love Randall more. No, he was just easier! MIGUEL: I married my best friend's wife. I've been on the outside of this family since I entered it. You're gone all day, every day. - Where do you go? - I have a cat. I go back and forth to feed him. His name's Clooney. One of those ironic names, 'cause he's a pretty ugly cat. ♪ Them that's got shall have ♪ ♪ Them that's not shall lose ♪ ♪ So the Bible said ♪ ♪ And it still is news ♪ (HORN HONKS) ♪ Mama may have ♪ ♪ Papa may have ♪ ♪ But God bless the child ♪ - ♪ That's got his own ♪ - (BARKING) ♪ That's got his own... ♪ ♪ ♪ synced and corrected by susinz *www.addic7ed.com* (SAW WHIRRING) (DOOR CLOSES) How goes the entertainment center that Jack built?

Oh, whatever. - You love my records. - Yeah. I do love your records. Mm-hmm. Oh, gross. Act more like parents. - (CHUCKLES) - Um, my friends and I are gonna go to the winter formal, so I need a dress. Um, Mom, do you think we could go to the mall? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Uh, can you give me 20 minutes? Yeah. Come on, Louis. (KISSES) Come on, boy. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Did that just happen? Did my teenage daughter just ask me to go to the mall with her? Sure did. Saw it with my own two eyes. Hey, babe, you mind if I go with you? I need to look at some suits. Walter wants us to \"step up our game,\" land a few more luxury condos. - Walter. Ech. - Yeah. \"Ech\" should definitely be that guy's last name. Oh, can you remind me to pick up batteries? - Yeah. Got it. Yeah. - Okay. KEVIN: Mom, Dad, I need more soda. - I got it. - Okay. (TV PLAYING) Hey, your mom is taking Kate to the mall to get a dress for the winter formal. Are you bringing Sophie to that? No. She doesn't really care if we go. Um, she's aware that I can't exactly dance. You know? Can't dance, can't walk, can't play football. - WOMAN: Where? Where do we get... - MAN (on TV): Look out! - WOMAN: What? What? (SCREAMING) - (TV TURNS OFF) - D-Dad, it's the best part. - Come on. Quit moping. We're gonna go to the mall, get you a new suit. Mall? I want to go to the mall. Great. God, he's weird. Get dressed. Come on. ♪ ♪ RANDALL: There you go, little man. You are now ready for the great migration. Be safe out there. This diorama is gonna crush the competition. I understand. Mm-hmm. - All right. - (PHONE BEEPS) - Dang it. - What? I just lost the lot on Clinton Avenue. The city just sold it to a Costco. So much for building a beautiful park for the hardworking people of Trenton, New Jersey. Now they get a Costco. I'd rather have a Costco there than a... Shh. I'm so sorry, wife. I know how hard you worked on that. - Thank you, baby. - Yeah. Um, you sure you're gonna have enough time to drop the girls, and... go all the way to William's place, then make it back in time for your job interview? Mm-hmm. I got time. Wouldn't rather spend that time preparing for the interview, than going to William's to pick up some random box they found in an old storage unit? No. I don't need to prepare. Keller's been after me for weeks. It's not getting me excited. Being a foster parent, now that got me excited. I know, Randall. And we're back on the list, but in the meantime, why don't you just... In the meantime, I'm gonna wait for something to come along that gets my juices flowing in the same way. But you're-you're gonna go to the job interview, right? (SIGHS) I'll go. But I'm telling you now, ain't doing nothing for my juices. KATE: And so, I fell off the wagon. Hard. You know, after the miscarriage, I just needed some comfort, you know? So I found that in Taco Bell. The Dorito shells are back, so... But now I'm on track, and I'm going to double down, because Toby and I are getting married in the spring. Yeah. And he's so friggin' romantic, he convinced me that I want the all-out traditional wedding, which means the all-out traditional wedding dress. Which doesn't exist for me. But it's okay, 'cause it's-it's just gonna be a hurdle for me. It's just... it's just a hurdle. So... Anyway, enough about me. Madison, why don't you say something that makes us all roll our eyes, or... something. (EXHALES) I think my wrists are getting fat. BARBARA: You know what? I'm very proud of you, Kevin. You've made the most of your time here. Well, thank you, Babs. That means a lot... I can call you Babs, right? - Still no. - We're not there yet? - No. But... - Okay. In here is in here, but out there, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. Did you steal that from Rent? No. My point being, is that it just takes one second to slip up. - Yeah. - And that's why I'm a little bit worried about you going back to Hollywood too quickly. I mean, you need structure, you need a healthy routine. - You're right. You're right. - Mm-hmm. It's exactly why I know where I need to be. Um... (SIGHS, CLAPS HANDS) My mom, um... a lot came out when she was here. And I figured this could be a chance for us to make up for lost time. Good for both of us. There's one small problem. Kev! You made it. Welcome. - How was the trip? - Oh, good. Good. You look great. So I got you organic bananas, and raw cashews. And, uh... I've got kale, so much kale. (LAUGHING): In fact, the woman at the grocery store asked me what I was gonna do with all this kale, and I said, \"You know what, my son is coming to town, and he's crazy about kale.\" - (LAUGHS) - (CHUCKLES) Well, yeah, yeah, no, normally, I-I would be, but, uh, I've actually switched, Mom, I've switched to a strict diet - of Skittles and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. - Oh. Because, uh... well, my therapist said it's okay to go nuts on sugar right now. But I can... I can, I can go to the grocery store, and get some of that stuff later. Oh, no. We, uh, we could go together, to the grocery store. - KEVIN: Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I never thought... that's great. Um... I need a schedule, right? I'm supposed to stick to it, so... this is good. Yeah, Mondays, I go to the grocery store - with Mom. - Mm. I can't believe I used to date Jessica Biel. - Oh, I like her. - That's... Yeah. Yeah, she's cute. You know, I think I'll tag along. - REBECCA: Okay. Sounds like a plan. - MIGUEL: Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I'm really sorry about what happened. (QUIETLY): With the baby. Thank you. Okay. So now I'm gonna propose something, - and before you say no... - No. I am taking you wedding dress shopping. Oh, that's a hard no. Kate, come on. I know the perfect place. They-they do custom dresses. You don't have to try anything on. You just have to sip champagne and-and talk about silhouettes, and you'll be treated like a princess. - I don't have to try anything on? - Nothing. I promise I can make this a nice thing for you. The moment you're at all uncomfortable, we leave. No hesitation, no questions. Let me help you clear this hurdle. ♪ ♪ REBECCA: Oh, okay. Yeah. That is the dress. I mean, with your eyes, Kate? Oof... ♪ I would sing my song... ♪ Sometimes brands run big or whatever, - so it's hard to know what size... - Yeah. No, I do the same thing. - Yeah. - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) - Okay, I'm going in. - Okay. Try and stay out of trouble. I will do my best. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) CLERK: Can I help you find something? I'm just waiting for my daughter. We're shopping together. JACK: Okay, so we're right here, and... the suit shop... the suit shop is right there. And Miguel's right there. Miguel! Hey! - JACK: Hey. What's going on? - Hey, Jack, Kevin. Hey. Let me guess: you're, uh, getting some suits to keep Walter off your back. Yep. And one for Kevin, too, - for his winter formal. - MIGUEL: Oh. Yeah. What'd you get? Uh, a really overpriced memory foam pillow... - Ah. - ...just to cheer myself up. Shelly's boyfriend proposed to her last night. Oof, I'm sorry. He did it on a ski trip. And the kids were there, too. - I guess they ski now. - Hey. You're always gonna be their dad, no matter what. - Okay? All right? - (LAUGHS) Classic. What? You just always do that. You know? You always go straight into a big pep talk. I think, sometimes, you just need a little bit of time to let things suck. - Really? - Yeah. Well, I mean, he's got a... he's got a point, Jack. I mean, sometimes, a guy just wants to... to be bummed about crappy things. KEVIN: Yeah. Okay, fine. I can wallow. What do you guys want? Arcade or food court? - Food court. - Food court. - All right, lead the way, Hopalong. - This guy's like - a foot taller than me, too. - Don't worry about it. (BUZZER SOUNDS) (PERSON WHISTLING) Lloyd? I'm Randall Pearson. You, uh, you called me about a box. I know William's son when I see him. - Come in, come in. - Thank you, sir. Yeah, sorry for the cold. Damn super won't fix the heat. Here. - Ah. There you go. - This is it? - Yeah, this is it. - Gotcha. Huh. Well, I-I guess that's it then. - Mm-hmm. - (LAUGHS) It was nice to meet you, Lloyd. - All right, yeah. - All right. I'm sorry. Were you the neighbor who took care of his cat, Clooney? Yes, but he took off a few weeks ago, probably once he realized William wasn't coming back. I'm sure he's fine, though. Strays always end up with someone who needs them. Yes, they do.

Hey, do you remember, um, do you remember when Dad used to take the entire cereal box and he would just dump the whole sucker out so that he could get the toy? Right? Before Randall and I had a chance to fight over it. - Do you remember that? - Aw, I do. - Ah. - Hmm. (CHUCKLES) I lost Dad's necklace. What? I tried to get it back and I-I couldn't. It's gone. Well, he would understand. You've been through a lot lately. - I don't know. - I do. - You know what's funny? - Hmm? Um, you beat yourself up about losing your necklace and I beat myself up because I can't seem to take mine off. MIGUEL: Apricot. - They have apricot LaCroix. - REBECCA: Yeah. KEVIN: Usually when I'm bummed, I watch football. MIGUEL: Mm-hmm. But now when I watch football, I just think about - how I'll never play football. - Mm-hmm. That's a catch-22 right there, man. - KEVIN: What's that? - MIGUEL: It's an expression. It's from a book. Shelly was always trying to get me to read more books. There's Randall. Randall! Hey! Finally. A breath of fresh air. Or not. What's with you? - Nothing. - Okay. Hey, look, Kev, you just, you have to find your new football. You know, what's something that you love to do? You don't get it, Dad. I mean, you didn't really have anything that you loved to do and then lost. Yeah, okay. (CHUCKLES) Hey, you're... that's probably true. No. No, it's not true. - You-you never told them about Big Three? - Mm. - What's that? - Nothing. No, your dad was gonna start his own construction company: Big Three Homes. - Really, you were? - Yeah. So why didn't you? Well, why do you think? I mean, he stuck it out with our company so that you two and your sister could have everything you've ever wanted. Look, it's... it wasn't the right time to take a risk like that. - Okay. - You got to own your choices, boys. Choose them fully and don't look back. - Hey, Miguel. - Yeah? Hey, uh, why, uh... - why did you come with us today? - Huh? Well, you know, obviously, I'm staying with you guys so that I can connect with my mom, right? But yet the first thing you do is... tag along with us to the grocery store. I was just, I was wondering why. She's been a wreck ever since you got arrested. And then you tore into her at that session. So, yeah, I'm here now to protect her against any more bombs that you might drop or any other blame that you might want to lay on her. Well, you don't have to protect her from me. I'm her son. And I'm her husband. My father was her husband. (KNOCKING) Hi. Sorry to bother you. I'm William Hill's son. Downstairs, apartment four. Oh, yes. I liked him so much. I was so sorry to hear that he had passed. Thank you. Say, did you like him or did you love him? Now, wasn't he a fancy man? Fancy? Nah, he was pretty low-k... oh, you mean gay. Yeah. No. Bi. Bye. N... William, he was just the best. Whenever the hot water would go out, which was a weekly occurrence around here, he would bring me a big ole pot of boiling water just so I could take a bath. Would you describe yourselves as romantically involved? (LAUGHS) Yo, what's going on, brah? Do you recognize this woman? Wow. I know. It's like being inside of a wedding cake. My gosh. Wait, are we the only ones here? It's B.A.O. By appointment only. I figured you'd be more comfortable if there were no other customers here. Thank you. Screw it, I am having one. I did yoga this morning, the sweaty kind. No judgment here. I know. - Hey, Mad. - Mm. I'm eating. Sorry. - Aw. - You are so tiny. I hate you. - (LAUGHS) - Alexis, this is Kate. - It's great to meet you. - Hi. I promise not to make you say yes to the dress or anything. Oh, I actually love that show. (WHISPERS): Me, too. (CHUCKLES) But don't tell Hanga. She thinks it's trash. (LAUGHS) - There we go. - Oh. - Thanks. - All right, come in.

Found one of William's old poems in this box that I picked up. - It's a love poem. - (BETH TYPING) Think he was in love... with a woman from his old building before he met Jessie. I think (WHISPERS) they were lovers. - Randall. - Yeah? I'm trying to do my job. I know you're kind of down on those right now, but I still have to do mine, so... I'm not down on jobs, Beth. I'm down on one particular job. I'm just waiting for the perfect thing. You think my job is perfect? You think when I was a wide-eyed, hardheaded undergrad writing all those papers on fair housing, that I dreamt that I would spend my life sucking up to public officials only to lose out to a Costco? - No. - I know you're searching for something. Nobody supports your searches more than I do, baby, but recently, it feels like you are somewhere in outer space. I need you to go back to work. It's not about money. It's... I think it'll be good for you. For us. Can you do that? Can you come down from outer space and be in the real world with me? BETH: Thank you. You would look absolutely stunning in something like this. Soft, empire waist, flairs out... But you have to love it. Do you love it? - I-I like the style. - Mm-hmm. But I'm just not sure about it being such a bright white. You know? What do you think? Madison? Wh-What do you think? MADISON: Agreed. Yeah, we're-we're not trying to blind anyone at this wedding, Lex. Show us something with flesh undertones. Got it. Uh... Ooh. How about this one? Mm-hmm? Yeah, way closer. BRB, I got to pee. How do you feel about lace? I like lace. MADISON: Here you go. Isn't Hanga's stuff amazing? Madison, I know what you did... back there. It's really just a small fee to reserve the place. It's-it's not a big deal. No. In the bathroom. After you ate all the macaroons. When you talk in group, it's not about anything... real. Or, at least that's what I thought. I mean, you went to town on those desserts... What are you doing? Madison... - No. Why are you ruining this? - Listen, I know that it's hard to talk about. - Ech... - Madison... MADISON: Just find your own way home. (CAR DOOR SLAMS) (CAR DRIVES AWAY) We're currently the frontrunner in the development of cellulosic ethanol. Not to toot our own horn, but it's pretty cutting-edge stuff. Does any of that appeal to you? Actually, yes. - (PHONE VIBRATES) - Sorry. I'm sorry, Sue, I should take this. Uh, it could be my kids' school. - Oh. Sure. - I'll be right back. I'm sorry. - (PHONE BEEPS) - Hey, this is Randall. LLOYD: Randall, it's Lloyd. Lloyd, yes. LLOYD: I saw your note in the hallway. Did you talk with the super? RANDALL: No. I spoke to a lot of people, but not the super. LLOYD: Well, Donna is with her grandkids on the first floor. RANDALL: She has kids? LLOYD: Now, I'm not one for gossip, but I saw William coming and going from that apartment at all hours, if you know what I mean. Oh, hell, I love gossip. (LAUGHS) Uh, thanks, Lloyd. Thank you very much. WOMAN (ON TV): Wait, why would you want to cover up... - MIGUEL (LAUGHING): What? - REBECCA (LAUGHING): Oh, goodness. \"Where are we gonna put our hot tub\"? It's a tiny house. What did they expect? Listen to her. Do you hear her voice? MIGUEL: Maybe I'll build you - a tiny house one day. - Oh. Hi, sweetheart. How are you? I'm just... restless, and nighttime's weird, and I'm... Why don't I go make you some tea? Yeah? You want some tea? You want tea? - Uh, sure. Thank you so much. - That's nice of you. Thank you. Your mother just can't get enough of this show. Yeah. Huh. (MIGUEL CLEARS THROAT) Uh... Miguel, I'm sorry about earlier. I'm... No, no, no, no. It's-it's... Me, too. Can I just ask you something? - Yeah, uh, anything. - Okay. Were you, uh... Were you in love with my mom when my dad was alive? What? (SCOFFS) Kevin, no. No, no, that... that would have been impossible. I don't know what you mean. How to explain this, um... See, your mom... your mom and dad, they were one. MIGUEL: There was... there was no Jack, and there was no Rebecca. It was just... it was just Jack and Rebecca. So, the notion that I would have been in love with your mother back then, it's just... it-it never even occurred to me. Ever. Do you understand what I'm saying? I do, yeah. But I do love her now. Kevin... I'm not going anywhere. (RINGTONE PLAYING) Hello? What? Wait, wait, what? (KNOCKING) Madison? Coming in. Madison? (MADISON GASPS, CRIES) Madison? (CRYING) - Oh, my God. - I'm okay. I think I fainted again. I... I'm okay. - Here, let me help you. - (SOBBING) Careful. Be careful. - (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. - Sorry. - You can't just leave me, Kate. How was the dress? It didn't fit. Well, why don't we go try on some others, then, - and find something that you love? - Mom, stop it! (SIGHS) Okay? Just... just please stop. (KNOCKING) - Hi. - Hi. You the super? Feeling pretty average, but yeah. That's a \"super\" joke. - Funny. - Okay. This is gonna seem random. I'm William Hill's son. He lived in apartment four. That old pain in my ass. - You know what he used to do? - Hmm? Every time somebody's stove wouldn't light, or their water wouldn't go on, he'd come banging on my door to report it. You know, and I explained to him a thousand times, I can't fix things without money. So, he wasn't coming around here - 'cause you two were... - (SNICKERS) - William and me? - Mm-hmm. (LAUGHING): No... No, no, no. I'll tell you this, though. When he moved, man, the building felt it, you know? It was kind of like we lost a heart, and there was no place for the blood to go. (PAPER SHUFFLES) I found this poem he wrote. Would you believe I thought it was a sign, me finding it now? Let me show you something. - Okay. - Okay. Come. The door... Just lost the tenant that lived here after William. Take a look around. That's okay. I don't want to... yeah. Take a look around. - (HORN HONKING) - BOY: Get it. Down to the right. Get it. WILLIAM: Well, what do we have here? - Ooh. - (CAT MEOWS) You are one ugly cat. No offense. You hungry? All right. Let's see what I can drum up for you. There's a little Lactaid. Hope you don't mind. - (MEWLING) - There we go. Yeah. Rough day, huh? You're good to hang here for a little bit. This is my favorite spot. It's got a great view of... \"Lady, I am straight up fixed on you... \"Always I walk the same steps. \"I push open the door, \"I end up in front of you. Always you. Always you, my Lady.\" ♪ God bless the child... ♪ Lady Day. Billie was one of my favorites. Oh, damn. (CHUCKLES) Oh, damn. - Sorry. - You don't need to take care of me. So... you're all alone and you're bleeding from the head. I kind of do. - I'm sorry I called. - Well...? I couldn't call my family. They'd... ... freak out. Do you want to talk about it? It's new. I mean, I used to do it in middle school, but I stopped, until a few weeks ago. I was really upset when I got home. So I ate. So much. This crappy frozen yogurt I've had in the freezer forever. And then I... I felt better. But I got really dizzy. I guess I fell. I know you think I'm insane. No. (CLEARS THROAT) I don't think you're insane. Um... Right before my dad died, I got really skinny. I pretty much stopped eating everything, except for baby carrots. Me and you, we could've shared clothes. And I was so, just so sure that being skinny would make me happy. My whole life, I had that voice in my head just screaming, just shouting at me, \"Lose the weight. Try harder. You're fat and you're pathetic.\" And so, I did it. I lost the weight. But listening to that voice my whole life, I didn't know who I was without it. And then I just, I felt empty. I was more comfortable being fat because I actually liked being mad at myself all the time. I liked the voice. So... I don't think you're insane. Thank you for taking care of me. - Oh, of course. - You're really nice. - (BOTH LAUGHING) - Eh. - Oh, my God. - What? Should we host a podcast? No. No one wants that. - (SIGHS) - Well... so... I think I like the dress with the empire waist. (GASPS) You're gonna say yes to the dress? Aw! (LAUGHS) I can't believe it. I finally have a best friend. (BETH SIGHS) Hey. Thanks for indulging me. This better be good. You're right. I've been doing a lot of searching these last few months. Spent too much time in outer space, but Beth, I got called up out of the blue and asked to come to this run-down building to pick up a cardboard box. And in that box was a poem about my father's lady, that turned out to be a Billie Holiday mural, but still, that poem led me directly to my lady, who wakes up every morning and fights to create beautiful spaces for the people who need them most. My lady, who's been the answer to every search I've been on since I was 19 years old. I want to buy this building with you, Beth. I want to change these people's lives.
