":"Previously on Desperate Housewives. Renee and Tom discussed their past. I seem to remember you caught me in a towel then, too. Bree's Thanksgiving dinner... I want a divorce. I'm happy to oblige! Dad! Mom... ...went up in flames. Look who's here. Gabby's dinner ended when Hector got arrested. I think they're illegals. I have to move out of our house... And she was afraid of losing her biological daughter, Grace. Stay with us until we can figure things out. And Paul's plan... You are the proud new owner of your old house! ...was set in motion. So Paige and I will be at the park for about 30 minutes. Great. I should have all the clothes packed up by then. Oh, shoot. I forgot the pacifier. I didn't. It's in the diaper bag. Have a good time. There are certain things every parent must remember. Which toys can't be thrown away, which vegetables must not be served, which clothes should never be mended. But the one thing every parent can forget is how quickly their children grow up. Hey, what's going on in here? Lisa Ellison is pregnant, so I'm gonna give her some baby clothes. Paige has grown out of all her onesies. Wow, that was fast. So fast. Isn't there a way we could keep her small? Well, we could stop feeding her. Then we could save money on food and clothes. Hey, you okay? Yeah, it just hit me that this is my last onesie. After Paige, no more babies. Isn't that what you wanted? I mean, weren't you the one who threw confetti after the doctor tied your tubes? Yes, but now I'm thinking that it's just going by too quick and before you know it, they'll be grown, and it'll just be you and me. And you know what the best part of that is? -No. -It'll be just you and me. What are you doing? Giving you a preview of what our retirement's gonna be like. What about... What about the kids? They all left for school. I saw them. But in the nursery? In front of Peter Pan? It's about time he grew up. Oh! Yes, there are certain things every parent must remember. I forgot Paige's doll. I'll... I'll... I'll tell her it's dead. Locking the door is one of them. It's a question we all ask ourselves. Do I trust the folks who live next door? Can I count on the woman who lives down the block? Will that couple across the street be there when I need them? Yes, good neighbors are people we can rely on. Great neighbors are the ones who do exactly what they are told. So this is what you want me to sign? Yes. Down at the bottom. Is there a problem? I'm just a little sad, that's all. Now what do you have to be sad about? I'm paying you well over market value. I know. It's just... I love the Lane. Everyone's always been so kind to me. To just up and move at my age... The neighborhood is about to change. In a few months, you won't recognize this street. It's better to go now with your memories intact. What do you mean it's gonna change? You don't have to worry about that. All you need to know is that I'm helping you. I am so sorry. I got hung up. Don't worry. It's done. Mr. Scully sold? But I had a lot of details to work out. I mean, the length of escrow, disclosure agreements... -You'll still get your commission. -Okay. So what happens now? Now? Now I let the neighborhood in on my plan. Plan? You have a plan? Hi! Oh. So now she knocks. It's Susan. I'm entering the house. It's okay, Susan. We are totally clothed. Oh. Sweetie, you avoided making eye contact with us all day yesterday. Can we move past this? Yeah, I think the only fair thing now is for us to see you and Mike naked. Okay, you were right. It's not funny. Yeah? I just want to say congratulations. For what? Well, I don't mean to be crass, but when I walked in on you guys, I couldn't help but notice that Tom is quite gifted. - Oh, that. -\"Oh, that\"? When I opened the door, I thought you two had company. I mean, I'm not sure if it was all the tiny furniture in the nursery, -but he looked... -I get it, I get it. I'm a very lucky woman. So, why haven't you ever mentioned it to me and the girls? Mention it? When we went for margaritas that night and we all, kind of, told each other about our husbands' \"accomplishments,\" how come you never told us you were sleeping with Tommy Tripod? \"Tommy Tripod\"? How many more of these do you have? Six. I'm serious. You were so tight-lipped that we just assumed that Tom was one of those, you know, button on a fur coat kind of guys. It's just something I don't care to advertise. What do I care if people think he's got a dinky one? Hey, Carmen. What's with the map? I just spoke to Hector. Oh, my God! How is he? Where is he? Staying with his cousin in Sabinas. M?xico. Grace and I will be leaving for Texas in two days. What? So soon? Gabby, we discussed this. We're staying with people we know for a few weeks until Hector crosses the border and joins us. And then what? I guess we'll try to get jobs, find a place to live. Where? What jobs? You have a daughter you're dragging into all this. Grace is a strong girl. Yes, I know, but is this what's best for her? Okay, look, I'm just putting it out there. Let Grace stay here with us. Just until you and Hector get settled. That could take months. I don't mind. That way she can at least stay in school, she'll be safe, be with family. Hector and I are all the family she needs. She comes with me. Carmen, I don't mean to make you mad. It's just... I have a say in this, too. I'm her birth mother. And I'm Juanita's! Does that mean I should take her with me? Take her where? To run? To hide? That's the life you're making Grace live! But here, she can have anything she wants. Just like Juanita. So she could become a spoiled girl who never thinks of others, just like Juanita. Hey. There is nothing wrong with my kid. No, you're right. It's not her fault she's being raised by a bad mother. And if a life of running and hiding keeps that from happening to Grace, then that is what I'll do. So we'll just tell people that you slipped in the bathroom and bumped your head. We're old, people expect that. What were you thinking with that book? I thought it would add a little spice. Kama Sutra. Kama sutures! Where did that come from? Wasn't there yesterday. Take these. Take these home. I gotta make sure people know about this. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! \"Correctional Center\"? What is that, a jail? I called the city. They say it's \"transitional\" housing for felons under house arrest. A halfway house for convicts on our street? -Exactly. -I don't understand. The city bought this house? No. I did. You're responsible for this? Sure am. What could you possibly be thinking? The day I was released from prison, I felt so blessed. I knew that I was coming home to the loving embrace of this beautiful neighborhood. And most inmates, when they're released, don't have that kind of support. Most of them are isolated, which leads them to commit more crimes. Bringing them to a place like this, where they can interact with folks like you, might just keep a few of them from making that unfortunate choice. Come on, Paul. We've got children here. And I'm not spending my golden years borrowing a cup of sugar from drug dealers and rapists. I'm all for charity, but our neighborhood can't handle something like this. Apparently, I have more faith in you people than you do. Oh, my God. In a way, this halfway house will be a testament to how I feel about each and every one of you. Renee? Oh. I've really got to start knocking. What? Lynette asked me to bring over this birthday card that got delivered to her house by mistake. Thanks so much. You can toss it. You're not gonna read it? Come on. Someone who loves you took the time to send a card. \"Happy birthday from \"Dr. Frank at Midtown Dental.\" Oh, look. You're due for a cleaning. -Goodbye, Susan. -No, wait. So it's your birthday, huh? Do you have something special planned? I haven't celebrated my birthday since the third time I turned 28. Hey, what do you say you and I go out? No candles, no cake, no singing. Just enough booze to wash away the pain. Why do you assume I'm in pain? Uh... I was talking about my pain. I've really been missing Mike since he's been in Alaska and I have a bunion that's bothering me... Fine, fine. We'll have dinner. Let's just make it early. I want to have a back-up dinner lined up just in case this one gets too depressing. Oh, I promise you're gonna have a great time. Hey, there's my favorite lawyer. As it happens, I need some good legal advice. You mean free legal advice. Well, yeah, free is good. So, let's say, hypothetically, I know a woman who's in this country illegally... You mean Carmen? She's not the only illegal I know. Half of Carlos' family scaled a fence at some point. Now, let's say this woman's daughter is an American citizen. You mean Grace? Hello? Still hypothetically. Now, could the daughter stay here with another family if, say, somebody anonymously reported the mother to Immigration? Yeah, as long as it's not the somebody who called Immigration, because hypothetically she'd be burning in hell. Come on, Carmen wants to drag Grace all over Guadala-somewhere, while Hector figures out a way to sneak back into the country. Gabby, you can't do this. They're a family. Just tell me, is it legal or not for me to keep her? Yes, technically, it's legal, but just because something's legal doesn't make it right. Okay, geez, you don't have to jump down my throat. Like I said, it was just hypothetical. Yeah, hi, can I get the number for the Immigration Department, please? What do you want for dinner? Pasta, meat loaf? I don't care. Meat loaf's good. Why don't you talk about my penis? Excuse me? I overheard you and Susan talking. I was surprised to find you'd never bragged about me. There's a reason they call them private parts. And why would you care, anyway? I know what you gals talk about when you get together. Gabby lets everyone know how much money Carlos has, Susan talks about what a badass Mike is. -So? -So do I always have to be the joke? The one who paid too much for the car, the one who cried when the cop pulled him over. You don't have a problem sharing my screw-ups, but God forbid you give me this one little victory. Are we really having this conversation? I'm just saying, for once it would be nice if you gave me a little good press. You know, tell your friends what I bring to the table. Please don't put it on the table. I'm sorry, I was looking for my contractor boyfriend, not a suave international spy. Well, the restaurant's pretty, how do the kids say it, snazzy. You look wonderful. Shall we? Hang on. I just gotta grab one thing out of my room. Okay. Oh, hey, Bree. I heard the door. I thought you were pizza. Hello, Richard. Are we going to bed, or getting up? I don't know, let's see. Ah, Wheel of Fortune. Getting up. So how are you doing? Not so hot. Mary's lawyer called today. We're starting our divorce proceedings. I'm so sorry. The marriage has been over for a long time, but I had no idea what a kick in the gut this was gonna be. I guess it's just hitting me that I could be alone for the rest of my life. Richard, that's ridiculous. Take a look in the mirror! I mean, after you shower. You are a catch. You're smart, adventurous, very handsome... For a tired old guy in his 50s. Stop wallowing in self-pity! You were a major in the army. Be strong. The army's easy. There's structure. They tell you what to do, you do it, but this... Fine. Then I'll tell you what do. Turn off the TV, get dressed and get out of this apartment. And do what? Ready to go? Change of plans. I've invited your father to join us. I hope you don't mind. Bree could see that I'm a little down. No. No, it's fine. It's not like I had anything special planned. Thanks. Okay, I checked the bylaws, we can all relax. Paul can't open a halfway house on this street without approval from the Homeowners' Association. And since he only has one house... He only gets one vote. No way he gets a majority. Thank God. Let's call a meeting of the Association and take a vote so we can get this over with. Does this seem too easy? I mean, Paul's a smart guy. He wouldn't pull a stunt like this, unless he thought he could get away with it. I wish Mike were here. He'd just go over there and scare some sense into him. Do we know any other macho guys who could do the job? What about Carlos? Forget Carlos. We've got a guy right here that can do the job. Roy. Not me. Hey, what about the gay? He looks like he could do some damage. Okay, how about I just refresh everyone's coffee, 'cause it looks like that's all I'm good for. Oh. Can you be a love and bring back more of these cookies? -You okay? -Bob? Roy? Your friends think everybody on the street is tougher than me. That's ridiculous. Hey, how about we send Lynette over there? She's got a set of cojones on her. You see? You see? This is all your fault! How is it my fault? 'Cause you never say anything positive about me. God forbid you talk me up, make these people think I'm a real man! A real man? Are you suggesting we make this meeting a forum for your talent? Why is it so hard for you to say nice things about me? I do! All the time. You prefer to emasculate me. Emasculate you? No, I don't! -Yes, you do. Yes, you do. -No. You want me to talk you up? -Yeah, that would be great. -Fine. I'll talk you up! Listen, everybody, I've got an idea. If we need someone to intimidate Paul, Tom can do it, in the men's room. What? Oh! You didn't hear? Tom's packing! We're talking big, circus big. So big he can drive in the car pool lane when he's alone. -Lynette... -If it falls in the forest, believe me, it makes a sound. -That's enough! -The Washington Monument looks at it and says, \"I want to be you when I grow up.\" Geez, you'd think she'd smile more. Grace, you want to go to the kitchen for a little bit? Why? Maybe make yourself a snack. You are such a brave little girl. If anything bad ever happens, you are surrounded by people who love you. -What are you talking about? -Gabby! Immigration's here. The men who took Daddy? Don't worry, Grace. Everything's gonna be okay. Mama! Grace, listen to me. Go upstairs to Juanita's room and do not move until I tell you. No, Mama. I want to stay with you. I'll be fine. I love you. I love you. Go! Go! These people are going to take me. I need you to look after my baby. You're not going anywhere. Can I help you? I'm Agent Jackson from ICE. We're looking for Carmen Sanchez. Is that you? Okay, Mrs. Solis, I'm going to the store now for oven cleaner. Are you Carmen Sanchez? Ma'am, we're from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I might be late tomorrow. This is lovely, Keith. Yeah, but it feels like something's missing. What is it? Oh, I know, my father. I'm sorry. I know we've been having a lot of dinners with him lately... No, it's okay. It's really sweet the way you've been looking after him. But I'm really glad it's just us tonight. Me, too. I'll check on our table. Wanna grab me a drink? Yeah. Whiskey up, ice water back. Can I help you? Watson, party of two. I'm the one who called earlier... Oh, yes, of course. Would you like the ring delivered in our chocolate souffl?? No, I'm too nervous to wait for dessert. How about an appetizer? We have the jumbo shrimp cocktail. Not jumbo. I don't want the shrimp to make the ring look small. -Thank you. - Bree? It's me, Tracy. Tracy Miller! Of course. It's been years. You look... Incredible. Look at me, I'm a stick. I've lost a ton. Good for you. What's Adam doing these days? Sitting in a studio apartment and cursing my divorce lawyer for taking all of his money. I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be. I'm doing great. They're ready for us. Oh, my God. Is this Andrew? I can't believe how grown up he is. No. This is my boyfriend, Keith. Wow. I guess we're both doing great. After the mudslides, there was an outbreak of cholera. Half my village died. That's when we paid the coyotes to bring us over the border. Geez, cholera, getting shot at... Doesn't anyone have a happy story about coming to this country? Gabrielle Solis? Your husband is here. Oh. Good luck. I'm sure I'll see you all again. You seem like a very persistent lot. You okay? As long as you're not mad at me. Are you kidding? That was a very brave thing that you did for Carmen. Yeah, well, you know me, always thinking about others. So, where are Carmen and Grace? Carmen was too scared to stay at the house. So I put them up in a motel. Well, you can tell them everything's fine, they can come home now. Gabby, you just made fools out of a US government agency. Our house isn't safe anymore. Carmen and Grace are leaving for Texas in the morning. Isn't this romantic? Like I said, I wanted this to be a special night for the two of us. Son of a bitch. Well, hey, you two. Richard, hi. What are you doing here? I thought if Keith were bringing a great cook like you here, it's got to be good. So I thought I'd order some take-out. Take-out. Good idea. Yeah. I thought maybe I'd take the food home and eat in front of the TV. Of course, it is Friday, there's probably nothing on. So I guess I'll just eat over the sink. Well, Richard, if you don't have plans, would you like to join us? Of course he has plans. Didn't you hear about the sink? I would love to. Let me get another chair. What are you doing? The man is clearly in pain. It's not your responsibility to cheer him up. When he is tired of being alone, he will meet somebody. Maybe sooner than you think. Tracy, I cannot get over how great you look. What is your secret? Revenge. After I lost the weight, I took a picture of myself naked and sent it to my ex to rub his face in it. Or to show him what he can't rub his face in. Am I right? You know, Richard, speaking of... Tracy here has an incredible singing voice. Oh, really? Yes, we met in church choir. Didn't you say you sang in your church choir? Still do. I love it. Yeah, I don't sing anymore. Or believe in God. Really? Yeah, it's kind of hard to believe in a higher power when you're on your knees, begging for help for your nightmare of a life, and you get squat. So, yes. That's how we met. The choir. Well, Tracy, not that God needs defending, but as someone who's been in combat, I have found my faith to be a comfort in difficult times. Isn't that refreshing? A man with old-fashioned values. I think we should cut all funding to the military and pour it into the schools. I hope they'll teach Arabic in those schools. So, shall we order? Bree, can I talk to you for a sec? Mmm-hmm. \"Shall we order\"? Are you not sitting at that table? This plan of yours isn't working. I admit she was much nicer when she was fat. Look, you need to get them out of here. I have to talk to you about something really important. What is it? I can't just blurt it out. It needs to be done just right. Hey! Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail with a puny engagement ring on the side? Oh, crap. Keith, what is that? No, no, forget you ever saw this! But Keith... I don't wanna hear your answer, Bree! This is not how this is happening! You never should've invited him to stay here. You ruined this entire thing! And so did you! And so did you! Well, he certainly killed the evening. So on Sunday, I make a big roast chicken. Then on Monday, I turn that into chicken salad. And on Tuesday, chicken soup. It's amazing how you can stretch a simple chicken... Into a 45-minute story? When you said you were the fun one on the Lane, who was your competition? The mailbox? I was just trying to cheer you up. Who said I need cheering up? Well... I saw you crying yesterday. For God's sake. This is a pity dinner? No. I just... I know what you're going through. Birthdays are hard. Especially when you're single. But I guarantee you you're going to meet someone. You're a very attractive woman. You think that's what I was crying about? Hey! You find me attractive? Yes. Would you wanna go out with me? Yeah. But we'd have to be very discreet, because my girlfriend... See? I have no problem getting a guy. So why the sob-fest? Do we really have to talk about this? No. On Wednesday, I make chicken potpie... Okay. Okay. Here's why I was crying. I was thinking about this great guy from my past. Oh. It was over 20 years ago. We only had one weekend together. But the way he made me feel... The older I get, I keep thinking that he was the one. And I let him slip away. What? That doesn't sound like you. There was someone else in the picture. Listen, we never know what's going to happen. I mean, Mike and I had our share of setbacks. But I never gave up. I never stopped dreaming that maybe one day it would work out. And neither should you. You know what, Susan? I just figured out your thing. You aren't the fun one, you're the smart one. You're good. I'll give you that. It speaks. Just when I think you can't find new ways to embarrass me, you top yourself. Well done, nutcracker. Wait a minute. Wait! Wait a minute. We were having a discussion about the future of our community, and you attacked me and turned it into a referendum about your manhood. You know, I wish I didn't have to do that. But I'm tired of all of our friends thinking that I'm just a buffoon. \"Buffoon\"? Are you insane? Every woman on this street constantly tells me that I have the perfect husband. They do not. They do. Gabby says that she wishes Carlos was thoughtful like you. Susan wishes Mike had your sense of humor. Bree says she's never seen a better dad. And why do you sound annoyed by that? How many people go up to you and tell you you have the perfect wife? Take your time. Well, lots. Oh, wrong. I know how our friends see us. You're the hard-working, nice guy, and I am the bitch. I am the one who's constantly emasculating her husband. I'm the one who can't wait to get away from her kids and go back to work. No, people don't say that. See, you are so nice, you can't even tell me the truth. For almost 20 years, all I've heard is how incredibly lucky I am to have a guy like you. So, if I don't constantly brag about how great you are, it's only because I don't wanna be reminded of how much I don't deserve you. You know, I'm the one who should be bragging to all the neighbors, telling them how lucky I am to be married to a woman who's still sexy as all get out, who makes me laugh, and whose heart is so big that even after raising five children, she still cries when she has to pack away the last onesie. I didn't cry. Okay, I teared up a bit. You know what I'm in the mood to do? I have an idea. It did everything but tap me on the shoulder. And that's how you get out of paying for a taxi. Well, we weren't in a taxi, we were in my car. But now I know why you showed me your boobs. Okay, that's a lot of stairs. How does sleeping on the couch sound? You know something? I told Lynette you were this mousy little loser. Actually, you told that to me. Oh. I'm sorry. 'Cause I really like you now. You're nice. Much nicer than that Susan. Okay. Nighty-night. You gonna be okay? I thought I was. I thought I could live down the street from him, but it's so hard. Wait. The guy you're in love with, he lives here? Yeah. Tom. Tom? Tom Scavo? Yeah. Love of my life. Hey, Richard. I was looking for Keith. Is he here? No, he went for a walk. You wanna wait for him? If you don't mind. I am so sorry I ruined your evening. Well, to be fair, you had some help. Still, if I had any idea he was gonna propose... No one was more surprised than me. This is none of my business, but if he'd pulled it off, what would you have said? Speaking as your prospective father-in-law, of course. I don't know. It's all a little sudden. Yeah, that's Keith. He's always been an impulsive kid. Never really thinks things through. Actually, his spontaneity is one of the things I love about him. Can I be honest with you? I would never put you and Keith together. Oh? Yeah, I see you with someone steady, more reliable. Someone who shares your faith, your old-fashioned values. Someone more your own age. Well, that being said, I really do love your son. I love him, too. Like I said, he's a great kid. I should go. Really? Please tell him that I stopped by. It's been so wonderful getting to know you. You, too, Mrs. Solis. What are you doing? Memorizing your face. Texas is far away. I don't know when I'm gonna see you again. Maybe someday. Yeah, maybe someday. Can I tell you something, Grace? I grew up just like you. I didn't have a lot of pretty things, but I never let that stop me from going after any dream I wanted. So you remember that, okay? Gabby. They need to go. I wish you could stay with us. Gabby... Okay. I'm sorry about what I said about Juanita the other day. Don't worry about it. We should go. Carmen. Thank you. Thank you for taking care of my baby. Thank you for taking care of mine. Oh, God. Hey, everybody, quiet down. This shouldn't take too long. We only have one order of business on the agenda tonight. And that is the new halfway house that is scheduled to open in the property owned by Paul Young. So let's jump right to the vote. All those opposed to the halfway house... Madam Chairwoman? Point of order. According to our bylaws, we have to have a 48-hour notice before a vote. We'll still vote the same way in two days, and you'll still lose. Yeah, that'll be 14 to 1. Then we'll take another vote to kick you off the street. That'll be 14 to 1, too. You might want to check your math. I have at least seven votes. How do you figure that? With the acquisition of Mr. Scully's place, I now own seven houses on Wisteria Lane. What? I used the settlement I got for my wrongful incarceration to acquire the extra property. Didn't I, Lee? You knew about this? He was my realtor. Couldn't have done it without him. He just hired me. I didn't know he was evil. How much money did you make from these deals, anyway? Not that much. So that's why you tried to buy my house? You never told us about that. Well, I made it pretty clear how I felt about his offer. Well, none of this matters. Seven houses isn't enough to win the vote. That's an excellent point, Gabby. I need one more. And since this halfway house means a lot to me, I intend to get it. Well, we're not gonna sell to you. I don't need all of you to sell. Just one. So if you're sure it won't happen, there won't be a problem. But if someone should sell, you'll have hardened criminals on this street. And what do you think that will do to your property values? Oh, my God. You can't scare us. Well, maybe not you, Carlos. You're rich. But what about Mitzi Kinsky? What about me? We all know you've been laid off. I can offer you well above market value. Or you, Mrs. McCluskey? I bet your entire life savings is tied up in your home. And, Susan, my offer still stands. We all know Mike had to go to Alaska because of your financial problems. But if you lose half the equity in your house, will he ever be able to come back? How much above market value? Mitzi! Look, I don't wanna sell, but if somebody else does, I'm screwed. No one else is gonna sell. We have to stick together. Hey, hey, hey. What's with all the whispering? This is private. Do you mind? Yes, I do. We're all waiting for you to tell Paul to shove it. We're just trying to figure out how to handle this. There is nothing to figure out. Hey, money bags. Don't yell at her. This is exactly what he's trying to do! He's trying to turn the whole Lane against... What the hell were you thinking? I didn't know what he was up to. You sold him seven houses. You didn't think that was a little strange? This is not his fault. So just back the hell off. Okay, guys. Come on, everybody, calm down. We're not gonna let you destroy this street. I don't have to. You're going to do it yourselves. It's a question we all ask ourselves. Do I trust the people who live next door? Will that couple across the street be there when I need them? Can I count on the woman who lives down the block? Yes, good neighbors are people we can rely on. But if we discover our neighbors can't be trusted, then it may be time to move."}
