":"Previously on Desperate Housewives. Why didn't you tell me you were having money problems? Susan made a difficult decision. - You can't sell your house. - We're not selling. We're renting. Bree was blackmailed by Sam. I'm talking about your son running down Carlos' mother. I want you to sign over your company to me. Patrick got what he needed to force Angie to do what he wanted. You're going to make me another bomb. But Angie managed to send out a call for help. And Lynette discovered that Eddie was the killer. In those first awful moments, all Lynette Scavo could think of were her children. The moment her daughter began to walk. The day her son won the spelling bee. And that time her twins scared her with a frog. Yes, this is what Lynette thought about while a disturbed young man was holding her hostage. Eddie, please... Don't talk to me, Mrs. Scavo! I really need to think. I know you must be scared. But I am your friend, Eddie. I want to help. What can you do? You can't do anything. I can tell people what a mean, angry drunk your mother was. How she abused you, how defenseless you were. You almost didn't have a choice. What about the others? What others? The other girls I killed. Oh. You still think you can help me? Look, I don't want to hurt you. Look, we'll drive till we're in the middle of nowhere. I'll drop you off, and... And by the time you find anyone to tell, I'll be gone. - No. - Look, I don't know what else to do. - I can't have you going to the police. - I can't go anywhere. Yes, all Lynette could think about were her children. My water just broke. Especially the child she was about to give birth to. Teresa Pruitt used to be a nurse. For 33 years, she worked in the maternity ward at Fairview Memorial Hospital. She spent her days caring for newborn infants and looking after brand-new mothers. It was a job she had loved with all her heart. But that was many years ago. Now Teresa Pruitt was back at Fairview Memorial, but this time as a patient, a patient with a secret. Hello, Teresa. I came as soon as I could. I'm so sorry. Don't be. It's my time. You're very brave. I wish that were true. Father, did you know I used to be a nurse in this hospital? Yes. You just retired a few years ago, right? I didn't retire. I quit out of guilt. What do you mean? I did something awful. Do you want to take confession? No. Confessions are private. And the people who run this hospital need to know what I did. Because they have to make it right. Excuse me. I need to see Nick Bolen. What room is he in? I'm sorry. Visiting hours don't start until 9:00. Okay, but this is an emergency. Ma'am, he just came out of a coma. Unless you're immediate family, you need to come back at 9:00. Okay. I get it. You're just following the rules. You're a nurse. An underpaid, under-appreciated nurse, who might need some help making ends meet. So, what do you say to $ 12? Wait, I'm going to need $ 10 for parking. Ma'am... How about gum? Do you like gum? Come back later. Hey, Lorna, Dr. Burke needs you in radiology. Thanks. Hey, you with the ponytail! I got to see Nick Bolen. Are you family? - Forget about it. I'm his wife, Angie. - Really? Well, then who's that blonde lady who has been here? His whore? She was here? I'm having her whacked! No, no. I could be wrong. Maybe I should get my supervisor. Do I look like I got time for supervisors? I got sauce on the stove, ziti in the oven, and a mustache that needs to get bleached. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Thank you, Parker. Wow, did we... Did we get hammered last night or what? No, you got hammered. Preston and I just followed you around apologizing to everyone. Another thing we won't be telling your mom. Hey, do you think I woke her up when I came in? - When you came in? - Yeah. No. When you jumped up on the coffee table and sang Margaritaville? Maybe. Guys, I just checked on Mom and she's not there. And the bed looks like it hasn't been slept in. God, she did hear me. She must've stormed out of here, first thing. But why didn't she wake you up and yell at you? Have I been stabbed? You're back. What happened with Sam? Yeah, did you tell him his services were no longer needed? I tried to. He responded by blackmailing me. What? He knows what happened to Mrs. Solis. Gabby? What does she have to do with this? I'm talking about Carlos' mother. What happened to Carlos' mother? Ten years ago, she died after being hit by a car that Andrew was driving. - Oh, my God. - How did he find out? - Danielle told him. - What? Why? I don't know. I think it was some idiotic attempt to bond with him. Wait a minute. - You never told Carlos and Gabby? - Of course not. It would have destroyed the friendship. Not to mention Carlos would have sent Andrew to jail. So, what does Sam want? My company. And I'm going to give it to him. - Are you crazy? - If I don't, he'll go to the police. - Let him. - Andrew! Mom, I'm not letting you give up everything you worked for just because that psycho thinks he has something over on us. They will send you to prison. Well, maybe it's time I paid for what I've done. Absolutely not. Bree, you can't give in to blackmail. It's not right. And if Andrew wants to take responsibility... Orson, this is really just between me and my son. Would you mind? Of course not. What's going on? Why am I wet? Beats me. I'm not a doctor. - Gabby, what are you doing here? - Angie's in trouble. Look, she wrote me this note. \"Danny and I held hostage. No cops. Get Nick.\" I don't understand. There was a guy with her. He said he was her brother. She doesn't have a brother. Is it Patrick Logan? You know about Patrick? She told me everything. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? - I got to get them out of there. - Wait. Are you crazy? In your condition? Why can't we just call the cops? Because the second Patrick feels cornered, Angie and Danny are dead. Oh, my God. - Are you going to be all right? - No. You're going to have to drive me and help me get them out of there. Okay. I know. I'm sorry, I'm putting you in a dangerous position. Forget about it. - So, you're done? - Yes. When you push the detonator, you got 30 seconds till it blows. You got what you wanted. You gonna let us go now? Not yet. You're coming with me to Oregon. You didn't say anything about that. Ang, what if the bomb's a dud? I mean, you did run off with another man and take my son. I've got some trust issues. - Will you at least let Danny go? - No. See, if the bomb doesn't go off, I'll put a bullet in your head, and then come back and kill him. So, you sure you're done? I guess I could take another look. My grandson's visiting. He'll love this. How about we give you 100 bucks? Look at the price tag, 50 cents. Please, Susan. Let us help you. I don't need my arthritis medication this month. Look, I can almost make a fist. Thank you. But we're not looking for a handout, just a hand. Hey, I just got off the phone with Lee. He thinks he might have found a renter. - Already? - That's a good thing, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. It's great. A stranger living in my house. Hey, Susan, how much for this dining room set? I paid $ 1,200 a year ago. You can have it for $300. I'll give you 50 bucks. I thought you weren't looking for a handout, just a hand? That's not a hand, that's a finger. Susan, I'm not neighbor Kinsky right now, I'm business Kinsky, so I'm going to be frank. You don't have a pot to pee-pee in right now, and the whole neighborhood knows it. What's it going to be? Jeez, Kinsky, have a heart. The woman needs the money. Keep out of it, McCluskey. You know the yard sale game. If you lost the stomach for it, walk away. - No, Mitzi, you walk away. - Excuse me? You're nothing but a vulture. I want you off my property. Hey, lookee here. I'm on a public sidewalk. Now what're you going to do? Mitzi, I am not neighbor Delfino. I am \"woman who's about to move into an apartment \"behind a gas station\" Delfino, and if you don't get out of my face, I am going to ram this ThighMaster down your throat. Fine. $300. Sold. I found some aspirin. Will that help? This isn't a headache. These are contractions. I need you to take me to a hospital. No. I can't. You'll tell someone about me. Eddie, I swear to God, I don't care about you right now. All I care about is this baby. Please! Porter, I found her. She's at Eddie's. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, it means she did not accept my apology, and it was fun being your dad. Okay. I'm trusting you here. Thank you. You have my word. Eddie? It's Tom! I need to talk to Lynette. - Quiet. - Honey, I can... I can see your car. I know you're in there. Lynette? Okay, I get it. You're giving me the silent treatment. Well, when you cool off, I will be home with a gigantic bouquet of your favorite flowers. I'm sorry. I had to do that. - I'll take you to the hospital now. - It's too late. It's too late. - What? - This baby is coming now. And you have to help me deliver it. - Mr. Chase, you got a minute? - Sure, Father. Come on in. I just came from Teresa Pruitt's bedside. - She passed. - I'm sorry to hear that. I remember her fondly. She was one of my best nurses. Before she died, she told me something. An awful secret that she'd been living with for years. Father, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your business, but aren't those things supposed to be confidential? She wanted you to hear this. But I think you should sit down first. Hey, lady. Unless you want to get carried into the truck, you need to get off that chair. I see. Like you're the mover. Funny. Have you seen T-Rex? Your dinosaur? Check in the boxes. - No, honey, we sold it to Roy. - No! - Yeah, you put it in the sell pile. - What's a sell pile? Uh-oh. I want my T-Rex. Well, buddy, I'm sorry. We sold it. So, there's no way we can... - We're getting it back. - What are you doing? - Loving my child. - Thank you, Mommy. Susan, I don't think you should have promised him that. Roy bought it for his grandson. It's bad enough that we are dragging him from the only home he has ever lived in and moving across town where he doesn't know a single soul. If that silly dinosaur brings him a moment's comfort, then we need to march over there and take it back. What the hell. We're moving. Let's go piss off some neighbors. And somehow the dinosaur got into the pile, and now MJ is begging us to get it back. Sorry for the confusion, Roy. No, I get it. It's just I already gave it to my grandson. Oh... I remember when we gave it to MJ. Right after his puppy died. Okay, okay. Let's go get it before you take out your violin. I guess the excitement of getting a new friend wore him out. - I'll wake him up. - You don't have to do that. Why don't you just slip it out of his arms, and we'll leave a note? A note? And cash. Mike, give the man some cash. No, we're not taking money. He's got tons of other toys. He'll be fine. God, he's deaf. Shouldn't we stop this? Let's let it play out. Here you go. You are now the sole owner of Mrs. Van De Kamp's Old Fashioned Foods. Of course, my lawyers will have to approve this. Of course. And they'll see there's a codicil. If you breathe one word of Andrew's involvement in that incident, you'll be forced to pay me all sorts of money. Don't worry. I'm much better at keeping secrets than your daughter. One can only hope. I didn't want it to be this way. And I understand if you need to hate me. I don't hate you, Sam. I feel sorry for you. You came into my life hoping to be a part of my family, and all you're leaving with is a client list, some mixing bowls and my name. Well, you will soon see, that's not enough. You'll always have a hole in your heart because you don't really care about anybody. And I have a horrible feeling that no one will ever really care about you. Now, would you please be a dear and close the door on your way out of my life? So I'm going to put the bomb in the trunk. And that's how long you have to say goodbye to our son. Okay, but you can't go with him. He's never going to let you come back. I don't know how this is going to play out. But whatever happens, you've got to know that I was out of choices. Okay, Ang, car's loaded. Come on. We've got a bomb to explode. Okay, okay, I've got to push again. - No, you have to look. - But it's so gross! I don't care. You're going to have to catch her. Go! I see something. I think it's the head. Wait. There's something around her neck. What? - I think it's the umbilical cord. - No. No! She's turning blue. Okay. Okay. Listen to me. You have to hook the umbilical cord with your finger - and pull it over her head. - No, I can't. - You have to. - No, Mrs. Scavo, I'm serious! Listen to me. You have the chance to save a life. Please. Okay. - Is it done? - Yeah. I got it. - Yes? Yes? - Yes! She's okay? Thank you. I know. I know. Where is he? I'm sorry, sweetie. T-Rex is extinct. Yeah, buddy. I'm sorry we couldn't get him back for you. But he's mine. That's not fair. MJ, that's life. Life isn't always fair. Sometimes you can be a good person and you can do the right thing, and life still won't give you your dinosaur back. In other words, we're going to take you to Pizza World and you can play all the video games you want. Okay. Susan, life didn't take your dinosaur. I did. So, please, just let me have it. Okay. Yeah, I resent you. I love you, I respect you, but you know what? You blew it. And thanks to you, I have to leave the home where I raised my children. Look. Look, this is how tall Julie was when she started kindergarten. And this is her in junior high. And this is MJ, the day we brought him home from the hospital and stood him up. And this, this is where I thought he'd get to. Here, in this house. And now I'm never going to know, and it's all your fault. There it is. Hey, we're going to get it back. I promise. In the meantime... Well, that's done. - It's Sam's company now. - So, you did it? You actually gave up a business you spent eight years building? What other choice did I have? I can always start a new company. What I cannot do is send my son to jail. You sent me to jail. You insisted I turn myself in. You said it was the only way you'd take me back. That was a completely different situation. Really? I ran over Mike and told no one. Andrew ran over Carlos' mother and told no one. How is that different? - Andrew was a child at the time. - He's not anymore. - Orson, please. - I don't mean to upset you. I'm just curious why you're not demanding Andrew do the same thing as well. Fine. I was wrong. I never should have asked you to make that sacrifice. I don't want an apology. I respected you for demanding better of me. You showed me you had principles and ideals. You insisted I live up to your standards. And I loved you for it. What are you saying? From the moment you told me what Andrew had done and what Sam was threatening to do, I saw this as a test. And I hoped with all my heart that you would pass it. But you have failed miserably. - Where are you going? - To pack my suitcase. I'm leaving. What? You're not the woman I thought you were. For God's sakes, Orson. He's my son. I have no choice. We always have a choice. And I no longer choose to be your husband. All right, I'm going to go around back, see if I can climb in a window. You think you can keep Patrick occupied for 10 minutes? Honey, you're talking to a woman who never paid for a drink in her life. Please. - Oh, man. - Are you okay? Yeah, just a little light-headed. Just give me a second. By the way, thank you. I can't believe you're helping us out like this. I don't know, I guess it's... I guess it's because I know what it's like to have secrets, too. It's a lonely feeling. And that night on the plane when Angie told me hers, I promised I would help her, whatever it takes. Nick? Nick. Oh, my God, don't pass out. Nick, come on. I can't do this alone. She's so small. Not for long. They grow up so quickly. I wish I could see her grow up. So, I'm going to go now. If you could just wait awhile before you call the police. Wait. That day you left my house, you told me your life would have turned out different if I'd been your mom. So, I'm going to be your mom now. Will you listen to me? I don't think you should leave. I think you should stay here and call the police. I can't. Yes, you can. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail. Honey, don't you see you're already there? No matter where you run to, in your head, you will still be angry. You will still be in pain. And as long as you want to keep hurting people, you will never be free. I'll be good. I swear. But people will never see that you're good unless you show them. Please, if you pick up the phone, they will know. And I will be so proud of you. Will you call them for me? Of course. Why don't you hold the baby? Hello, Fairview Hospital? I need to know how to bring someone out of a coma. Well, I'm not sure if it's a coma. Somewhere between a coma and a nap. How should I know if he's clammy? I left him in the car. Gabby? Hey, Susan. What's up? - I just came to say goodbye. - Okay. All right, see you. No, I mean, this is it. Tomorrow's moving day and it's going to be crazy. So, I didn't want to rush through our goodbyes. Good for you. I'll catch you when I catch you. Hello? Hello? Damn it! Susan! I'm sorry, I'm just so choked up about you leaving, I just couldn't deal with it. Really? You know who else is going to be devastated? Angie. - Angie Bolen? - Yes! She's totally broken up about this. You've got to say goodbye. Seriously? I mean, I like her and everything. - I just... We've had our problems. - Just neighbor stuff. Well, I tried to crush her son with his car. - One of her favorite stories. - And then she attacked me with a bat. She's Italian. That's love. Now, come on. You know, Angie once told me that a goodbye doesn't mean anything - if it doesn't last 10 minutes. - Really? Because I don't think Angie and I have ever had a conversation that lasted more than... Gabby? Okay. It's getting late. Let's go. Yeah, these aren't going to draw any attention. Not as much as a bullet in the head if you try to run. It's my neighbor, Susan. Someone really needs to thin this herd. Get rid of her. Susan. What's going on? Well, tomorrow's moving day. I just came to say goodbye. Okay. Bye. Don't you want my new address? Relax, Ang. This will be over before you know it. It's okay, Danny. I'm going to get you out of here. Why are we stopping? What's the range on this thing, about 200 yards? Yeah. Why? Patrick, what are you doing? When I woke up that morning 20 years ago, and you were gone, I was devastated. I tried to forgive you, but I couldn't. After all, you didn't just betray me, you betrayed everything we believed in. So I decided one day I would find you and I would punish you. And today is that day, my love. Where's the bomb? There's 30 seconds from the time I push this detonator till the explosion. That's what you said, right? - Tell me where the bomb is, now. - It's in your house. And if you want to save our son, I suggest you get moving. - Come on, hurry, I got to help my mom. - I'm trying. Okay. It's in the detonator. You bitch. Mom? Gabby, we can't take this. This is too much. I insist. Although, I am gonna need $ 10 for parking. So, this is goodbye. Forever, right? I mean, that's how this works? Yeah. You know what's funny? Nick had to drag me here kicking and screaming. He told me it would be a good place to blend in because people wave at you from behind their little picket fences, but they would never get involved. They don't care. Well, thank God you proved him wrong. Take care. So, we better hurry. The bus is leaving in five minutes. Yeah. You should give him his ticket. This is a ticket to New York. I thought the plan was to go to Atlanta. That's our plan. - No way. - Listen to me... - I want to be with you guys. - And we want to be with you. - But we have to stop being selfish. - She's right. It's time we let you live your life. You're going to have so much fun in New York. You get to be with Ana. You can see Grandma. And you can finally stop running. But I'll still get to see you guys every once in a while. Right? I mean, Patrick's dead. The FBI's still looking for us. I don't think I can do this. I'm not ready for... Hey, hey, hey, hey. You are gonna be fine. All right? Because you... You have turned into one hell of a man. Yeah. If I am, it's 'cause you were my father. Okay. Mom? Why is all of Orson's stuff gone? He left me. What? Why? He feels I'm a hypocrite. That's ridiculous. No, he's right. I am. Is there anything I can do? There is. You can give me your permission to do something I should have done a long time ago. This is bad. What if we don't say anything? The nurse is dead. Nobody else knows. The priest knows. I don't suppose we could buy him off. Just a suggestion. If this leads to a lawsuit, we have no defense. This could ruin the hospital. - Jack, what's wrong? - I know one of these families. They live two blocks from me on Wisteria Lane. Then maybe you're the best person to tell them. And how do I do that? How do you tell parents the child they've been raising, the child they love, isn't really theirs? Hey, there. What's going on? Susan. Trying to sneak off without saying goodbye. The more I thought about it, the more I realized it's not a big deal. I'm just moving across town. I'm going to see you all Friday for poker. You'd better. Because if we don't hear from you once a week, we will hunt you down and bring you back. You know that, right? I do. So, who's renting your house? Lee found a guy. It's just not going to seem right, someone else in your house. Yeah, well, whoever the guy is, he is very lucky. Because he's about to get himself three of the most wonderful neighbors a person could ask for. You know, sometimes when you see people every day, you forget to tell them how much they mean to you. So, for the record, I think the three of you are such good people. And you've made me a better person, and I thank you for that. Hey, Susan, I hate to interrupt, but we really got to get going. I should go check on Tom and the baby. I'm sure one or both will need to be fed. - Go, go. I'll call you all in the morning. - Okay. Honey, what's wrong? What Susan said, it's not true. I'm not a good person. That's silly. Of course you are. No, I'm not. There's something I need to tell you. I should have told you years ago. But I didn't. You sound so serious. What is it? It's the kind of thing that could end our friendship. Can we go talk? Well, are you ready? Yeah. Drive away slow, okay? As they pulled away, Susan looked out on the street she loved so much. A street where parents could raise their children, where retirees could enjoy their golden years, where good friends could share horrible secrets. Yes, Susan looked on this street and vowed she would be back. But as she did so, she didn't notice the car that passed her. A car carrying Wisteria Lane's newest resident. So, I have some paperwork for you to sign over here. And once we get this done, I can give you the keys. And I just know you're really going to like it here. People are friendly, relatively quiet. It's just... It's just a lovely neighborhood. I know the neighborhood very well. The truth is, I used to live here. Then I guess everyone will be surprised to see you again. They absolutely will."}
