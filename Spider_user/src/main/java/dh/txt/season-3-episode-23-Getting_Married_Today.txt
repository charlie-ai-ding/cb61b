 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: Victor made himself perfectly clear. Whenever I've

 wanted something, I've always gotten it. - Bree needed to get away.

 - Finally taking our honeymoon. Susan couldn't wait to pop the question.

 - Will you marry me? - [laughs] Lynette received shocking news. You

 can see this. It could be lymphoma. Why are you reluctant to

 commit? - I'm not in love with you. - Edie... - What

 if we tried to have a baby? - ... engaged in a

 dangerous deception. When Gabrielle Solis agreed to marry Victor Lang, she was

 determined to have a very traditional wedding. She was even more determined

 to be a very traditional bride. To that end, the handkerchief in

 her cleavage was borrowed, the garter on her leg was blue and

 the diamonds on her ears were old. But sadly for Gabrielle, something

 was missing. And she was about to throw a traditional fit. It

 is after three! Where the hell is Bree with my something new?

 Her plane landed on time. She'll probably be here any second. I

 should have my head examined for agreeing to this. Who the hell

 cares about Swiss jewelry anyway? Gabby, Bree went out of her way

 to buy you that bracelet. Of course it's the hottest day of

 the year. All the guests are out there sweating like pigs. My

 reception's going to look like the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

 If you're freaked out, get married without the bracelet. Are you out

 of your mind? Can't get married without my \"something new.\" Oh, I

 have an idea. I just got a lipstick yesterday. You could wear

 that. I just paid a makeup artist 500 bucks to do my

 face. Think I want to march down the aisle looking like I

 ate a popsicle? OK, it's your big day, so I'm gonna let

 that slide. God, it is ten after, and Bree is never late!

 Where can she be? All right, that's it. After I finish zhuzhing

 my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime. I can't believe my wedding's

 already ruined and it hasn't even started. [Susan screams] I am starting

 to get worried about Bree. Maybe we should call. Yeah, I'm calling

 her cell. - It's ringing. - Oh, good. - Bree! - Oh,

 wow. - Hello, ladies. - [Gabby] Is that Bree? She better not

 have come empty-handed. Oh, I didn't. [Mary Alice] As promised, Bree had

 arrived with something new. Holy crap. And she also... brought the bracelet.

 Family. There is nothing more important. They are the ones we want

 to laugh with during the good times. And the ones we need

 to console us during the bad. And even though the time comes

 when they have to leave us... ... their voices still linger in

 our minds. And, sometimes, we can't help but listen. Tangled web. That's

 what you're weaving. Oh, beat it, Mother. Really think this scheme of

 yours is gonna work? Of course it will. Look at him. He's

 practically in love with me already. That's because he thinks you're gonna

 give him a baby. Wait till he finds out you're still on

 the pill. Shut up, would you? I just thank the good Lord

 your father didn't live to see this. Well, neither did you! You

 died alone in a trailer park watching game shows. And why should

 I listen to you? 'Cause I know what's waiting for you, missy.

 This one's gonna leave you like all the others. You're going to

 end up old and alone, just like I did. [gasps] Carlos? Carlos!

 - [Carlos] Down here, babe! - [Edie sighs] - I'm making you

 a fruit smoothie. - [doorbell rings] - Chicken or fish? - What?

 Haven't gotten your reply card. Chicken or fish? - Oh, right, your

 wedding. I can't go. - Why not? I'm a jinx. Look how

 your last marriage turned out. Come on, Gabby, we both know it'd

 be weird if I went. OK, maybe a little. But it'll be

 weirder if you don't. - Excuse me? - Everyone knows you living

 with Edie. If she shows up alone, people'll think I asked her

 not to bring you, like it bugs me you guys are together.

 It does. You hit the roof when you found out. Which is

 why I have to show people that I'm OK with it! Please.

 Just consider it my wedding gift. OK. But I'm skipping the ceremony.

 What? And just go to the reception? You can't do that! Well,

 I don't want to make a scene. You'll vow \"till death do

 us part,\" I'll bust out laughing, people will stare... The reception starts

 at four. I'm thinking a chocolate fountain'd be a cool centerpiece to

 a dessert buffet. Dessert buffet? We're having a wedding cake, right? -

 Isn't that dessert? - You have to give people a choice. Don't

 you think a chocolate fountain'd be elegant? I don't know. You, a

 big white dress, melted chocolate. Am I the only one hearing alarm

 bells? Fine, we'll skip the chocolate. How about a champagne fountain? I

 know. We can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture. Don't

 you think we might be going over the top? Mike, these are

 all fairly standard wedding features. Now you name one thing that you

 think is going over the top. How about the dove wrangler? The

 doves are not going to release themselves. Do we really need 40

 of them? OK, I know that you think that I'm being silly,

 but all of our friends went to Bree's wedding, and now Gabby's.

 Two months from now, do we want them thinking ours wasn't as

 nice? Seems to me our friends wouldn't be there to make petty

 comparisons, - they'd be there to celebrate our love. - You would

 think that, but no. Come on, this is something that we have

 both looked forward to for so long. Don't you want it to

 be perfect? Oh, I guess. About the doves, though. What? You in

 a wedding gown, 40 birds circling overhead? Again, not liking those odds.

 Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's Hodgkin's Lymphoma and,

 apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want.

 Hey, you want to hold it down up there, kids? I'm trying

 to talk to your Aunt Lucy! Thank you. Anyway, I know I

 said that we would come and visit you this June, but I'll

 be a little woozy and bald from the chemo, so... Oh, thanks

 for understanding. Oh, one more thing. Our insurance policy has a really

 high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and I was wondering if

 maybe you and Dave might be able to... Oh, really? No, I

 am not asking Mom. She doesn't know about any of this, so

 don't you tell her, OK? We'll be fine. I love you. Bye.

 I take it that's a no on the loan. Yep, Dave lost

 his job at the plant, and he is now handing out fliers

 at a chicken restaurant and, prepare to wince, there is a chicken

 suit involved. Ouch. Where are we gonna find this $10,000? You leave

 that to me. I want you to focus on getting better. -

 But honey... - I will find it. Meanwhile, we'll make some sacrifices

 around here. My tennis club membership is up this month. I'm not

 renewing. Should you be playing tennis after your back surgery? Probably not.

 Well, in that spirit, as soon as I start chemo, I will

 be giving up shampoo. OK, thanks. Taxi's here. Are you sure you're

 ready to go back? We could wait another week. And miss Gabby's

 wedding? No, I'll be fine. Is this the dress you were thinking

 for the ceremony? Yes. Oh, good. I'll fold it in tissue so

 it doesn't wrinkle. Oh, darling. I don't deserve you. Oh, come on,

 we agreed, no more tears. I'm so sorry to be putting you

 through this. I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and

 never looked back. Stop. I'm going to raise this child and love

 it as if it were my own. Now, let's see a smile.

 Glad you could join us, Milton. Good to get to know you

 before the wedding. Thank you. You know, I must say, all these

 months I thought Victor was exaggerating, but he hasn't done you justice.

 You, my dear, are a flawless beauty. [chuckles] I'm hardly flawless. I'm

 sure I have a blemish hidden away somewhere. That's a search I'd

 relish. - She is way out of your league, Dad. - Honey,

 he's a multimillionaire. He runs my league. [laughs] By the way, I

 ran into Keith Perkinson last week. - How is the venerable state

 chairman? - Impressed with you. Liked the way you ran your campaign.

 If you keep your numbers up, he might consider supporting you -

 in the next governor's race. - Really? [laughs] - What's so funny?

 - You've got to be kidding, right? Just finished a campaign. You're

 not about to put me through another one. - But I thought

 you loved campaigning. - God, no. It's a complete snore. Pasting a

 smile on my face while you say the same speech for the

 50th time. But you were a natural. People loved you. Well, the

 feeling wasn't mutual. You think I enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy

 matrons who wore loud poly-blend pantsuits? Know how many times I wanted

 to scream, \"Vote for my husband, you colorblind cow!\" I think you've

 discovered something very important about democracy. The nation is full of fools,

 and everyone gets a vote. They're not gonna get us again. I

 made nice with Fairview, I'm not about to suck up to the

 whole damn state. What are you doing? Some guy out in Mount

 Pleasant's got a cracked water heater. It's three in the morning. Well,

 I started advertising as a 24-hour plumber. After midnight, I get triple

 time. OK, that's crazy. You can't work around the clock. It's not

 healthy. This is the third night I've worked this week. I'm fine

 so far. You've been sneaking out while I've been asleep? What are

 you, ninja plumber? It's just for a little while, to earn some

 extra money. Is this about the wedding? We agreed we want it

 to be nice. But we didn't agree on this. Maybe I can

 scale things back a bit. How? Have a ginger ale fountain? Make

 paper doves and hope it's windy? OK, seriously, you don't have to

 kill yourself. I could max out my credit card. Is that really

 how you want to start our life together, in debt? No, I

 want to start out happy. Clearly, you're upset, and I don't know

 why. I'm not Ian. I can't afford to move you into a

 mansion or fly you off to Paris. I'll be damned if I

 don't give you the same dream wedding he'd have given you. I'll

 see you in the morning. - [doorbell rings] - [kids chatter] Where

 the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me

 about it? Mom. How do you think you could handle this without

 me? - Stella? - Oh, there's my Tommy-boy. Come here. Oh, God.

 Oh, listen, be a love, will you, honey, and get my bags

 from the cab. Bags? She's staying? Yep. And do not tip the

 driver. SOB wouldn't let me smoke. Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know you

 opened a daycare center. Hey, kids, Grandma's here. OK, what did you

 tell them about me? It's been five years, Mom. They don't remember

 you. They'll remember me this time, I brought presents. - Cool! -

 Hey. For you, and you and you. These are baby toys. We're

 too old to play with these. I'm too old to remember what

 the hell six-year-olds like. - We're eight! - What do I care?

 - Just say \"thank you.\" - Thank you. Oh, who's the pretty

 thing? Your girlfriend? - No! She's my sister! - Oh... Is that

 Tom's little b-a-s-t-a...? OK, kids! Time to get your toys and play

 upstairs. Come on, Penny. Come on, sweetie. Let's go, everybody. Listen, I

 really appreciate you coming to help, but - as you can see,

 I'm perfectly fine. - [scoffs] For now. How are you gonna handle

 that mob when you're flat on your ass from chemo? I'll manage.

 You got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.

 I was not alone. I had you. Lynette was all of 13,

 and she still looked after her sisters, cleaned the house, cooked the

 meals, and I was curled up in a ball, puking my guts

 out. Well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka

 gimlets. You can goad me all you like, Lynette. I did not

 come here to fight. Now trust me, cookie, I have memorized the

 whole catalogue of subjects you and I can no longer discuss. If

 that means that we have to talk about the weather for three

 months, then fine. But I am staying. Now, if you'll excuse me,

 I have to go kick a child out of its room. [Edie

 moans, giggles] OK, legs up. Oh, you want to do it again?

 No. I've been doing a lot of research, and gravity helps facilitate

 the sperm reaching the eggs. So heave-ho! Could we try a little

 light spooning before you hang me like a side of beef? Edie,

 we're trying to have a baby. Well, could we be a little

 less clinical? Maybe let nature take its course. Nature is not on

 our side anymore. You're no spring chicken and those eggs aren't exactly

 farm fresh. OK, stop referring to me as poultry! Sorry. Can we

 just try this? It's only for 30 minutes. Thirty minutes! I am

 not staying in this position for half an hour! Listen, I know

 that this requires some work, but it will all be worth it

 when we have our beautiful, beautiful baby, right? Right. I guess I

 could make some sacrifices. That's my girl. - Can I get you

 anything? - Yeah, I'd kill for a beer. - Sorry. No alcohol.

 - What? For how long? Just until the baby's born. Oh, and

 you stop nursing. Don't worry, I'll get you a nice herbal tea.

 Just for a few months, while you're in treatment. We're gonna have

 to find someone to watch the kids. No! I am not leaving

 that woman in charge of our children. In three months, the twins

 will be chain-smoking and Penny will be an alcoholic. We can manage.

 We've got McCluskey. She costs money. Money we won't have if we

 pay someone to replace you at work. You said not to worry

 about money, you'd find it somewhere. I did. What? Someone loaned us

 $10,000? No, gave us. And we can't thank her by kicking her

 out. No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother! Didn't have to. She

 knew that you hit up Lucy, so she offered. - Well, we're

 giving it back. - No, we can't afford to. Tom, you don't

 know half the stuff she did to us. She would get drunk

 and smack us around. She'd meet some new guy, and then drop

 us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into

 kids. OK, so she was a crappy mom. You said yourself that

 she has mellowed. - Now she wants to make amends. - If

 you would just try to understand. I think that I've been pretty

 understanding lately. - What's that supposed to mean? - I think you

 know. In the middle of everything I'm dealing with, you're gonna throw

 Rick in my face? When someone we love hurts us, if we

 still love them, we deal with it and we move on. If

 I can do it, so can you. So forgiving my mother, that's

 my penance? Yeah. I think it is. You said we weren't supposed

 to spend - the night before the wedding together. - I was

 trying to respect tradition, but I got horny. Wow. I guess we'll

 just have to start the honeymoon early, won't we? - Let me

 get rid of this stuff. - What are you working on so

 late? Nothing. Polling data? Why are you polling? The election's over. Just

 a little research. God, you look hot. Is this about running for

 governor? I told you how I feel about that. My dad just

 set up a little exploratory committee. - It's no big deal. -

 OK, let's explore it now. - Nope. Not gonna happen. - Gabby.

 Victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fundraisers, -

 and I'm sick of it! - I'm a politician. Think I want

 my career - to begin and end in the suburbs? - Fairview's

 home. Don't want to leave! Can't make this decision without me! Gonna

 be your wife. - Exactly! Not my career advisor. - I don't

 get a vote? - Not if it's a veto! - OK, look,

 no! I already married a man who put his career before me,

 and I swore I wasn't going to again. Well, I swore I

 would not let a stupid woman hold me back! That did not

 come out the way I wanted it to. I'm sorry. I'm sor...

 I'm really sorry. I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Well,

 here's one less thing you have to worry about: our wedding. You

 can't cancel the wedding. It's too late. As far as I'm concerned,

 it's just in the nick of time. [doorbell rings] Good morning, Gabby.

 God, Milton, the newspaper's not even here yet. I'm sorry it's so

 early. I just came to apologize. Why? What happened wasn't your fault.

 That's not exactly the case. - Is that coffee I smell? -

 [sighs] You only bolted because Victor wants to be governor. He only

 wants to be governor because of me. You suggested it. You can't

 make him go after something he doesn't want. The hell I can't.

 Ever since he was a kid, Victor's been killing himself trying to

 live up to his big-shot father. - He's desperate for my approval.

 - Why? I suppose because he's never gotten it. Everything he does,

 even becoming mayor, I somehow let him know that it's not quite

 enough. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm right to push. - That's

 why he's so successful. - So, what are you saying, I should

 marry Victor because you're a withholding father? No, I just want you

 to understand why he does what he does. Fine. I get it.

 But why would I want a husband who values his father's opinion

 more than mine? Well, he doesn't really care much what I think

 anymore. After you left last night he called me and, what's the

 phrase, \"tore me a new one.\" - He did? - He said,

 because of me, he'd lost the best thing that had ever happened

 to him. And if he couldn't win you back, I could take

 my money and buy a new son because I was never going

 to be hearing from him again. He blew off 80 million? Well,

 if he cares about me so damn much, why am I not

 hearing this from him? I think you're about to. Is there a

 back way out of here? Aren't you going to be late for

 Gabby's wedding? Oh, weddings are boring. I like to sneak in at

 the end, look teary-eyed and pretend I was there the whole time.

 I am going to see you at the reception. Oh! Uh, hi,

 Danny. Carlos, the paper boy's here! Could you pay him? Come on

 in. Hey. Here you go, Danny. Oh, looks like I'm a little

 short. Can I catch you later? No. All right, hold on. -

 Oh, my God. - What's that? It's birth control pills. I'm gonna

 need cash. - [Andrew] Welcome home. - I have missed you, sweetheart.

 Here, allow me. Well, hello there, Julie. - You guys are back!

 - Wow, somebody's blonder. Oh, yeah, my mom hates it too. So

 where's Danielle? Well, while we were in Switzerland she ran across this

 boarding school. She fell in love with it and just insisted that

 we - let her spend a year abroad. - Wow. She must

 be having a good time. She hasn't returned any of my phone

 calls. Oh, well, you know, her school's up in the mountains and

 her cell phone reception is kind of funky. She hasn't answered my

 e-mails either. I am going to call her tonight and have a

 little talk with her about common courtesy and I'm sure that you'll

 get an e-mail tomorrow morning. We should go. Got to get that

 bracelet to Gabby before the wedding. Well, I'll see you guys there.

 Bye. - Well, that was uncomfortable. - You have no idea. Everyone's

 been asking questions. This might not be as easy as we'd hoped.

 [guests chatter] There. Now you have something new. So how do I

 look? You are now, officially, the most beautiful bride that ever lived.

 - Until your wedding, of course. - Nice save. It means so

 much to me that we're all here together right now. And break!

 Love you. [minister] We are gathered here today to join together... ...

 Victor Lang and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony. An honorable estate not to

 be entered into lightly, but reverently and soberly. This is a lifetime

 union, based on love, honor, and trust. Be my new best friend.

 Premium scotch. Keep it coming. You are promising to accept each other.

 Promising not only to love for today, but to extend that love...

 Carlos! I thought you weren't coming until... Save it. If these two

 should not be together, speak now... - OK, look, I can explain.

 - Don't bother! Your lies were more convincing when I cared. Victor,

 do you take Gabrielle to be your lawful wedded wife, - through

 good times and bad... - Carlos! You've got to understand! I do

 want to have a baby with you, just not yet! I just...

 I wanted to give you a chance to fall in love with

 me first. I don't believe you. And I will never trust you

 again. Well, what was I supposed to do? You backed me into

 a corner! And you were gonna bail on us and I was

 just trying to save what we had! Carlos, don't leave me. -

 Please just talk to me. - I am done with you. Carlos!

 [minister] Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, - Mr. and Mrs.

 Victor Lang! - [crowd applauds] I'm sorry! [cries] Mrs. McCluskey. Enjoy the

 wedding? Nice. Very classy. What the hell was that brouhaha between Carlos

 and Edie? I don't know and I don't care. Today I am

 so filled with love, I can forgive anyone anything. Oh, but if

 you do see them again, call security. So we're in Z?rich and

 I am sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row.

 I thought to myself, \"Dear God, I hope I have not developed

 an allergy to chocolate brioche. Life wouldn't be worth living.\" I said,

 \"That's it, we're seeing a doctor.\" You could've knocked us over with

 a feather when he said she was two months pregnant. I think

 it's so great and we could not be happier for you. -

 When's your due date? - Not until the fall, but enough about

 me. This is your day. You and Victor. - Who, by the

 way, I have not met yet. - My gosh, that's right. OK,

 you stay here, I'm going to go grab him. [sighs] It's so

 good to be back. I can't believe how much is happening. I

 mean, you and Gabby getting married, and I'm having a baby. What's

 going on with you, Lynette? Nothing. Same old, same old. Really? Everything

 OK, sweetie? You haven't seemed yourself the last couple weeks. I'm fine.

 Everything's just fine. [Victor] I'll tell you this much, I'm exhausted. I'll

 be glad when this day's over. [Milton] Well, it was all worth

 it. Marrying Gabby is the smartest thing you've ever done. Her bringing

 the Latino vote, the governor's mansion's yours. Well, that's assuming I can

 change her mind. Had to make concessions to get her down the

 aisle. Well, you're the husband now. The rules have changed. Be nice,

 buy her a few pretty things. Trust me, you'll be able to

 tame that little spitfire. Not worried. I've always been able to manage

 my assets. Did you find him? No. I'm still looking, but I'll

 let you know. - [music on TV] - Movie's over, amen. Go

 out and play. Go on. Out. They're just gonna go play guns.

 Can I watch another movie? Lynette said one was the limit and

 she'll be home soon. No, she won't. Whenever they go out they

 always come home at least an hour later than they say they

 will. Aren't you an observant little monkey. Tell me, sweetie, would you

 know anything about a man named Rick? Yeah, I know Rick. My

 daddy and Lynette had a big fight about him. Really? Sounds like

 there's, maybe, a little story there. If I tell you, could I

 watch a really good grown-up movie? If it's a really good grown-up

 story. OK, I got you some appetizers to tide you over. We

 have mini-quiches and beef satay and something called Crystal Coast shrimp with

 grits, but it's mostly grits because I ate all the shrimp on

 my way over. Mike? Reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony. Really

 just heartfelt and moving. The whole package. - Why, thank you. -

 It was really impressive. So, what are you doing tonight? Carlos. I

 didn't know you were in here. I got a little thirsty. Yes,

 I can see that. Gabby, I am sorry if I ruined your

 wedding. But if it's any consolation, I also ruined my life. [chuckles]

 What are you talking about? A couple years ago I was totally

 happy. I had a home, you, a great career. And I don't

 understand how I let it all go to hell. And now, here

 I am, back at square one. [chuckles] I really blew it. What

 am I doing? I shouldn't be dumping this on you. It's your

 wedding day. Go to Victor. I'm going to stay right here... Well,

 I don't know how you did it. The kids are asleep and

 the cough syrup hasn't been touched. Boy, you're just waiting for an

 excuse to give me the boot. Well, if history's any indicator, I

 won't have to wait long. So you don't think people can change?

 [chuckles] I think, at a certain point, people just are who they

 are. Well, I think people can change. Now take you. You were

 the perfect wife and mom. Then along came Rick. - How did

 you...? - Come on, Lynette. You were young when I was sneaking

 around, but you knew something was up. - You heard about this

 from my kids? - Just the girl. And all she knows is

 that, \"Daddy got mad because Rick liked you.\" Nothing happened between me

 and Rick. Yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, I

 controlled myself. Well, you had Tom to come home to. I had

 your stepfather. Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we

 had a father in that house were the happiest of my life.

 You didn't care about that though, did you? You just drove him

 away. And you couldn't wait to pay me back! Do you remember

 what you said the next year? When I got sick? - No,

 I don't. - Liar. You said I earned it. It was God's

 punishment. How are you feeling now, Lynette? You think you're being punished?

 How can you say that? You were so sanctimonious. You could not

 imagine what sort of woman could do that kind of thing. Not

 so hard to imagine now, is it? Stop comparing us. I never

 did what you did. No, you just wanted to. You're leaving tomorrow.

 I don't want your money. - I don't want you in my

 house. - Hey! You are sick, Lynette. You think you know what

 you're in for 'cause you watched me go through it? Watching it

 is nothing. You are going to feel worse than you thought a

 person could feel, and I'll be holding your hand through every damn

 minute. You can't stay if I don't want you here. You can

 fight me or you can fight the cancer. Trust me, you won't

 have the strength to do both. Andrew, do young people still say

 \"awesome\"? Not so much. Try \"off the hook.\" \"Off the hook\"? That

 doesn't make sense. Fine. Type in \"groovy.\" See if I care. Hello.

 Hodge residence. Oh, hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending Julie Mayer an

 e-mail from you. Now would you say that your school was quote,

 off the hook, unquote? No. I would say it was \"sucky,\" or

 \"crappy,\" or \"a freaking nightmare.\" If you're gonna complain, I'm going to

 hang up. Mom, you have got to talk to the nuns. They

 are so harsh with me. And they have all these stupid rules.

 If those rules had been in place when you took up with

 Edie's nephew, you might not be in this pickle. Mom, please, I

 just want to come home. Look, I am gonna say this one

 last time. You are gonna stay put until that baby is born.

 Don't forget, we're driving up this weekend and I am bringing your

 favorite, lemon squares. And... - Darling, can I draw you a bath?

 - Oh, that would be lovely. Oh, would you give me a

 hand, please? There you go. - Almost time for the six-month size.

 - Oh, don't remind me. No. No, it's no problem. I can

 fix that for you. Just give me your name and address. [woman]

 I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott and I'm at 42 Old Mill Road. I've

 got to stop and pick up a Douglas valve, but I should

 be there in 45 minutes tops. I hate to see you drive

 when you're this tired. There's some iced coffee in the fridge. I'll

 be fine. See you when I get back. - You were great.

 - Did y'all ever doubt I would be? Hurry up and get

 dressed. - We only have 45 minutes! - OK. Are you Mike?

 Yeah. I'm looking for a Mrs. Walcott's house. You've come to the

 right place. Here, put this on. You mind telling me what Susan's

 up to? Ask her yourself. Hello. Are you sure about this? I

 don't want you to look back and regret not having your perfect

 wedding. I don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of a

 perfect wedding keeps changing. One day I want white roses and then

 I want lilies. First I want a harpist and then a string

 quartet. Only one thing stays constant... ...and I'm looking at him. Why

 would I need anything else to make my wedding perfect? Well, who

 knew downsizing could be so romantic? Yeah. - Mrs. Walcott, I presume?

 - That's right, sugar. You might want to check that breast pocket

 of your suit. Just so you know, you'll be paying for those

 and the lights and the flowers. I've never seen you look so
