 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. No sex for at least a month. Bree made

 a decision. Focus on getting me a divorce. And hired Angie. Let's

 get cooking. Gabby struggled at home. - What is going on? -

 It's called homeschooling! Lynette's body was changing. I have to hide these

 things at work so Carlos doesn't find out I'm pregnant. Cops wanted

 to know where you were the night that Julie Mayer was strangled.

 You know I never attacked her. Angie knew about the affair. Is

 it true you shot Katherine Mayfair? And Susan got in trouble. If

 someone wanted proof that Judge Mary Gallagher had a sense of humor,

 all they needed to do was watch her pronounce sentence. For the

 slumlord who refused to fix a furnace. You have to live in

 your own tenement, for a month starting in December. The woman who

 threw a phone at her maid. You will clean Mrs. Garcia's home

 for the next six weeks. And yes, you will do windows. For

 the high school coach who made lewd remarks to a cheerleader. At

 the next school assembly, you will perform a cheer, in uniform, and

 I'd shave those legs if I were you. And then there was

 the case of the housewife who shot her neighbor. You'll stand next

 to me. So, she just popped up in my window and I

 fired. It was an accident. Liar! It was no accident! She wanted

 me dead! I did not! At least, not then. As you can

 see, Your Honor, this is an unfortunate situation. It's a mess, is

 what it is. I assume there's some history here. - She once

 dated my husband. - She stole him from me. Stole? He came

 screaming back like he was running from a fire! Enough! I take

 it you're the man in question. Oh. Yes, Your Honor. I could

 see shooting someone over you. Thank you. Okay. I'm going to rule

 now. My inclination is to avoid giving out jail time in this

 case. - I object! - Overruled! However, a firearm was discharged, and

 there are consequences for that. Your Honor, before you hand down your

 ruling, may I say something? Make it quick. I already find you

 uninteresting. Not only did Susan shoot me at point-blank range, she trashed

 me to all of my friends and neighbors, telling them I was

 some kind of crazy, stalking nut. That true? Have you been trashing

 her? I never said \"nut.\" I said \"loon.\" Mmm-hmm. Mrs. Delfino? Okay,

 I trashed her a little, but what I said was true, and

 that's free speech. You can't punish me for that. Yes, when it

 came to sentencing, Judge Mary Gallagher had a sense of humor. But

 not everyone found her funny. There is a coffee shop in Fairview.

 It's known as a place where you can read your morning paper,

 where you can meet your friends, where you can bump into your

 neighbors, whether you want to or not. Hi. Boy, I hope they

 have decaf today. Last time I was here, they were out, so

 I had to have regular and got so wired, I didn't sleep

 all night. Does that happen to you? Seriously? You think I'm gonna

 make small talk with you? Excuse me? I know you slept with

 my husband. Oh. So, I'm thinking we're past the chit-chat stage. I

 am so sorry. Let me tell you how shame works. When you

 see the wife of the guy you banged, you don't make conversation.

 You don't even smile and say hi. You avert your gaze and

 you blush. Nod if you understand. Here's your mocha latte. That'll be

 $3.50. It's on her. She owes me. Hey. You're going to be

 late for class. - Dad? - All my clothes are too tight.

 - I had to borrow yours. - I was going to wear

 that shirt today. Well, when you're hiding your fourth month of pregnancy

 with twins, you can have it back. What do you think? I'm

 still attracted to you in men's clothes. Is that weird? All I

 need is to pull this off for two more days. You should

 have told Carlos two months ago. There's no way he won't be

 furious when he finds out. Tom, I may be wearing men's clothes,

 but I am not an idiot. I've got this. Terrence Henderson and

 I are about to close the biggest deal in the history of

 this company. Once Carlos sees how great Terrence is, he'll see the

 work can still get done, even when I'm on maternity leave. And

 you're sure this deal is going to close? Nope. That's why we

 need to keep our fingers crossed. Okay now, wish me luck. Good

 luck. Now come here, Mister. I want to kiss you. Okay, now

 it's weird. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Go ahead, my

 child. Well, I've been homeschooling my daughter, and it's been a living

 hell. So, I tried to bribe someone to get her into Catholic

 school. And what happened? Well, you tell me. Gabrielle, what are you

 doing? Come on, Padre! You're the head of admissions, and you've got

 a great school here, but there's a two-year waiting list. Put your

 money away. It's your money! Sleep with it for a while. See

 how it feels. No! I wish I could help, but my hands

 are tied. Come on, I'm not asking you to part the Red

 Sea. Just find a spot for one kid in the second grade.

 Look, if a student were to withdraw, I might be able to

 move you to the top of the waiting list. - Fantastic. -

 But, frankly, we tend to favor those - who are more faithful.

 - What does that mean? Well, I've noticed that you don't come

 to mass very often. Oh. I hear you, Padre. You're okay with

 money, as long as it comes in one of those little wicker

 baskets you pass around. No, that's not what I'm saying. Of course

 not! I realize it's dark in here, but just know I'm winking

 back. So, your first opera. That's quite a milestone. Throw in \"last\"

 and it's two milestones. Oh, stop. I saw you tear up at

 the end of Act 2. Only because I realized there was an

 Act 3. Madame Butterfly is Puccini's masterpiece. Didn't you enjoy it just

 a little? What about that scene when Butterfly tells her child not

 to feel sorrow for her mother's desertion? Didn't that make you feel

 anything? Actually, that's when you leaned forward and I saw a little

 peek of your boob, so I guess it made me feel horny.

 Karl, don't! Come on, it's a dark parking structure. People are just

 going to think I'm mugging you. We agreed, no sex for a

 month. We need to find out if we can be together in

 a non-sexual manner. I'm serious. Can you keep your hands to yourself?

 Can I? Thanks to you, it's my only choice. Hey, how was

 your business dinner? Oh, uh... Our bid was too high. Looks like

 they're going to go with another caterer. What are you listening to?

 It's a new recording of Madame Butterfly. Isn't it glorious? It is.

 I should go to bed, Orson. Good night. All right, guys, you

 sign the lease and we'll pop the champagne. The Florida branch is

 officially a go. Terrific. So, when do we get our branch manager?

 We've got somebody great lined up. We just need to finalize some

 things. We'll get back to you. Thanks. Who do we have lined

 up? Nobody. That's the thing we need to finalize. But today, we

 celebrate. Lynette, you really hit this one out of the park. I've

 got to give credit where credit is due. Terrence did a lot

 of the heavy lifting on this one. And I don't care if

 I embarrass him. This guy is a star. Strangely, I'm not embarrassed.

 Carlos, I didn't want to interrupt your phone call, but your wife

 is here. Just tell her to wait in my office until we've

 finished. You listen to me, Carlos Solis! I just came from St.

 Ursula's, and we've got big trouble! Do not blow me off! So,

 according to the Catholic Church, we're not holy enough, but I have

 a feeling a big fat check might slap on a halo. -

 How big? - Well, something that'll make a priest say \"holy\" and

 \"mother\" in the same sentence. That should get her to the top

 of the waiting list. I'm not going to write a big check

 on the chance that it might get her in. - Carlos! -

 Gabby, I can't do this now. You know the problems that I'm

 facing trying to get the new Florida office up and running. Now,

 if you don't mind... Fine. Can I trouble you for $5? I'll

 buy Juanita a hairnet and prepare her for a future in the

 fast-food industry. Hey! Hello, gentlemen. What? A lot of people are wearing

 this style. Well, it doesn't make it right. Hey, Gabby. I heard

 you mention St. Ursula's. It is worth the hassle. Our daughter Molly's

 in the second grade, and she loves it there. Oh, I didn't

 know Molly was in the same grade as Juanita. Yeah. Would you

 excuse me for a second? Hey, that branch in Florida? I think

 I found our man. No, no, no! You can't send Terrence to

 Florida. You should take it as a compliment. You trained him well.

 Exactly! You can't send him away! What if you need him here?

 Why would I? I've got you. But what if I was hit

 by a bus and I was put on bed rest for, say,

 three months? Who... Who would cover for me? That's not going to

 happen. Hey, you jinxed it. Now for sure, some version of that

 is gonna happen. Lynette, it's done. We are sending Terrence to Florida.

 And I really like this new look that you've got going. But

 careful, Roberta in accounting asked if I thought you'd like to go

 bowling with her. Hi, Susan. Oh, God. What are you doing here?

 I was just having lunch with some friends who are not on

 a chain gang. Thought I'd stop by and say hi. - You

 mean stop by and gloat. - Maybe a little. So, how's it

 going? Meeting anybody? They say the friends you make on the inside,

 you'll have for life. Yes, Katherine, this all sucks. But you know

 what? At the end of the day, I go home to Mike,

 which means I won. That's big talk for a woman standing in

 an orange jumpsuit with blisters on her feet. Well, Mike will rub

 them when I go home. And for the record, I totally make

 this work. The fact that you think you look good in orange

 shows I'm not dealing with a rational person. By the way, you

 missed something. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. Bye-bye! Hey!

 Come back here! - She littered! Shoot her! - What a moron.

 I wish I'd caught her license plate number. She'd be sorry. Really?

 What kind of damage could you do with her home address? You

 missed something. - Did you get them all? - You're supposed to

 eat it, not wear it. Well, they call it crumb cake for

 a reason. Come on. Emily, can you steam me some 2% milk?

 Hey. This is what happens when I'm five minutes late? - What?

 - The waitress, with the hands? - She was brushing crumbs off

 my shirt. - What, the ones Julie missed? Oh, my God. Is

 this how it's gonna be every time I talk to a woman?

 Yeah. Probably. Ange, I'm sorry. I don't know how many times I

 can say it. I'll do anything you want. I'll do couples therapy.

 Great idea. Let's tell somebody all our secrets, and then when we're

 cured, we can kill him. I don't know what you want. I

 want you to be the guy you used to be, the guy

 who saved my life, not the guy who destroyed it. How are

 we doing here? Never been better. - Hey! - Hi! - Come

 on in! - Yeah! - This is so nice of you. -

 Oh, no. It's not every day that one of my associates gets

 a big promotion. Thank you. Tom, why don't you take Crystal into

 the den and get comfortable, while I steal this guy to help

 me make cocktails? Come on, right this way. So, how excited are

 you? Miami! Pretty jazzed. It's an exciting opportunity. I think it's great

 how you're concentrating on the upside of this. There's a downside? No!

 Not really. Forget I mentioned it. It's just... Do you remember Tim

 Baker who was sent to head up our Chicago office? - Never

 heard of him. - Exactly. So, you are moving to Florida. Wow!

 - Pecan? - No, thanks. I'm on a diet. Yeah, I can't

 wait. No more winter. Yep. Just heat and hurricanes. I'm willing to

 put up with that. Miami has so many other things to offer.

 It certainly must, to attract all those Colombian drug lords. The Chicago

 branch was a little slow out of the gate. Corporate freaked, and

 made Tim the scapegoat. - Where's he now? - He's in plastics.

 Or paper, depending on what you want your groceries in. Wine? And

 when they cut into the alligator's stomach, not only was the guy's

 arm still intact, but it was still holding his golf club. I

 think he would've been fine if his wife hadn't left him. That

 led directly to the alcoholism, which probably had something to do with

 him threatening the president. Boy, is that a bitch on the old

 resume. That humidity, your hair. I think it's a recipe for cotton

 candy. Here we go, everybody, we've got the wine. I would like

 to propose a toast. To Terrence and Crystal, may Miami be everything

 you think it will. Hear, hear. - Knock, knock. Anybody home? -

 Come on in, Angie. This is pretty. What is it? It's from

 the opera Madame Butterfly. She sounds so sad. Actually, in this aria,

 Butterfly is hopeful that one day her lover will return to her.

 - Oh. Does he? - No. Because of his abandonment, she kills

 herself. Huh. You ever see Avenue Q, the musical, with the puppets?

 Now that's good theater. Bree's not here. What do you want? Well,

 I need to talk to her about some work stuff. Where is

 she? She's out. That's generally where Bree is these days, out. She's

 meeting with a prospective client, so she says. She's had four client

 meetings this week, and not one has resulted in a booking. Why

 do you think that is? It's a rough economy. See, I think

 she's taken a lover. What? Come on. No way. - How can

 you be so sure? - An affair? Oh, please. The woman makes

 her own croutons. Perhaps. Angie, I have to go away on a

 golf weekend. While I'm gone, could you do me a favor and

 keep an eye on Bree? - What do you mean? - Just

 observe her. Does she come home at night? Is anyone with her?

 Look, if you want to be paranoid, go ahead. It's a free

 country. But I am not going to spy on your wife for

 you. Yes. I suppose that's for the best. I mean, if I

 did find out she was betraying me, I'd probably do something stupid.

 Toughen up. It's just a little dust. Look, I have to clean

 that area. Would you mind having your breakdown someplace else? Just leave

 me alone, okay? You won, I lost. Isn't that enough? What? When

 you're sitting on the side of the road picking up Styrofoam and

 wads of gum, it's time to admit defeat. The man I love

 chose you. It's over. - Are you messing with me? - No.

 I'm being honest. Why has this been so hard on me? Well,

 you loved him. I did. I really did. And now he's gone.

 Katherine, you're an attractive, intelligent woman. - You're going to meet other

 guys. - Not like Mike. We connected on so many different levels,

 intellectually, emotionally, sexually. Oh, I've never felt such passion. Where am I

 going to find another guy who'll make love to me five times

 in one day? - That's a lie. - No, it's not. Five

 times? Susan, come on. Don't tell me that you and Mike have

 never... Oh. Hmm. Maybe I didn't lose after all. Remind me to

 ask you what you want for breakfast more often. - It beats

 a bowl of oatmeal, doesn't it? - You kidding? That beat a

 waffle. Listen. I have a crazy idea. Why don't we both call

 in sick and spend the day in bed, naked, together. Did I

 mention naked? - You want to go for seconds? - Mmm-hmm. What's

 gotten into you? Even on my birthday, you told me to hurry

 up because The Bachelor was on. Can't a wife just want to

 spend time with her husband? Well, yeah. It's just that your timing's

 bad. I've got to finish Mr. Henkle's shower. I promised him I'd

 be there yesterday. I'm serious. The old man hasn't had a shower

 in three days, and that's a long time for an old man

 to not take a shower. Oh, the hell with it. He survived

 World War II. He'll get through this. Father Crowley, hi. This is

 for you. Thought I'd catch up on my giving to my favorite

 parish. Wow. I certainly didn't expect this. Well, do with it what

 you will. Buy a new pipe organ, help the needy, take a

 trip to Tahiti. I really don't care. Listen, I don't know which

 nun you're going to put my kid with, but make sure she's

 had a tetanus shot. Juanita's a biter. Gabrielle, I think you're jumping

 the gun here. Why? A spot opened up. Molly Henderson is moving

 to Florida, right? Well, she was. Her father was going to take

 a new job, but he decided against it. What? No! No! This

 can't be! I'm afraid it is. Anyway, how did you even know

 about this? We'll talk about it in confession. Have faith, Gabrielle. When

 God closes a door, he opens a window. Thank you, Father Crowley.

 Hey, I got the stuff for the mushroom tarts. How's that cake

 coming along? Just when I think I can't top myself, I do.

 How about that. By the way, Orson thinks you're having an affair.

 - He thinks what now? - He thinks you're stepping out, but

 I told him there is no way Bree Van De Kamp is

 whoring it up in some sleazy motel. Thank you for that. Sorry

 to spring it on you like that. I just felt you should

 know what he was saying. Well, I appreciate it. I just don't

 understand why he would go to you. Well, he was drinking a

 lot. Also, he asked me if I would spy on you. Relax,

 Bree. Obviously, I said no. And I appreciate that, too. Would you

 mind cleaning this up for me? Are you sure you're done topping

 yourself? This is serious, Karl. He asked Angie to spy on me,

 and God knows who else he has watching me. I don't think

 we should see each other again until after you've gotten me a

 divorce. Don't ask me how. You're the lawyer! Hey, aren't you supposed

 to be at school? You never come home for lunch. I thought

 I'd try something different. Hey, since we're both home, why don't we

 go upstairs and make love? What, seriously? You want to do it

 again? I just got a sub from Martinelli's. Mike, I am offering

 you a nooner. Drop your pants and get upstairs. Can I bring

 my sandwich? Yes! Bring it. Grab a pickle. I don't care. -

 You're the best wife ever. - Come on! Can I turn on

 The Three Stooges, too? Lynette, it's Gabby! In a minute! Hey, Gabby.

 Hey, Nanook. Why are you wearing a parka? Because fur is murder.

 What's up? I talked to Crystal Henderson, and she said you talked

 Terrence out of going to Miami. Is that true? I didn't talk

 him out of it. I merely pointed out the pros and the

 cons. Well, apparently the cons won. You've got to un-talk him out

 of it! I need him out of this state. Why? Are you

 sleeping with him? No! The truth is, if he doesn't go, Juanita

 can't take his kid's spot at St. Ursula's! You're unbelievable. You want

 this guy to uproot his entire life just so you can get

 out of homeschooling your daughter? Yeah, yeah. \"Selfish Gabby,\" same old song,

 join in if you know the words. Well, sorry, Gabby. I need

 Terrence here. Why? Are you sleeping with him? No! I just need

 him here. Every time I turn around, someone is trying to make

 my life more complicated. Why can't everyone just let it go? Hey,

 I'm sorry. Come here. Everything's gonna be okay. I don't know why

 you're getting so upset. - What was that? - What was what?

 Your stomach just kicked me. Open the parka! - I'd rather not.

 - Open it! You're pregnant! Why didn't you tell me? Because I

 knew you'd tell Carlos. Yeah, so I tell Carlos. What's wrong with...

 Oh, no. When Carlos offered you that promotion, you knew you were

 pregnant, and you knew you'd be leaving him in the lurch? -

 Gabby... - Carlos just got this company. He brought in people he

 could depend on, and he thought he could depend on you! I

 didn't tell Carlos because I knew I was the best person for

 the job, and I wanted to prove it. Well, you certainly proved

 something. Gabby, wait. Please don't tell Carlos. I think he should hear

 it from me. Yeah. Better late than never, right? Susan, I'm home.

 Are you hungry? Up here! Hello, lover. Oh, God. Susan, I can't.

 I got nothing left. I hit my hand with a wrench today,

 and when I cried, only dust came out. You cried? That is

 so sexy. What is going on with you? It's like you just

 got out of prison. Is there a problem with a husband and

 wife having sex? We have a passionate relationship, don't we? Well, of

 course we do. It's just, I was hoping that tonight we could

 cuddle. - Cuddle? Am I that repulsive to you? - What? It's

 okay, Mike, you can say it. I'm a lousy lay. Susan, we

 had sex three times today. All right? I can't do it again.

 It's not you, it's basic biology. Really? Biology? Well, here is some

 basic math. You had sex with Katherine five times in one day,

 and me, three. Five minus three equals, Katherine turns you on, and

 sex with me is a chore! You and Katherine actually talked about

 this? More like she rubbed it in my face. Okay. Look, the

 only reason that that record ever happened was we got snowed in

 during a ski trip. And we had absolutely nothing to talk about.

 Sex was all we ever had. Don't you get it? There was

 nothing else to the relationship. But you and I, we've got everything.

 We have a rich, full life together. We can finish each other's

 sentences. - Mike, I... - \"Have been so foolish.\" Is that what

 you were going to say? - And? - You want to cuddle.

 I was gonna say The Bachelor is on, but cuddling is good,

 too. Karl, what are you doing here? Someone could see you! Yeah,

 especially if you leave me standing on your doorstep. Relax. I parked

 two blocks away. I don't appreciate your taking risks like this. If

 Orson finds out about... You won't have that to worry about much

 longer. I found a way to spring you from this marriage. -

 Orson's still on parole, right? - For another year. Why? If he

 violates parole by, for instance, associating with a known felon, - they

 can revoke it. - Then send him back to jail. All we

 need to do is get some ex-con in a room with Orson,

 take some pictures, and bam! He can't touch you because, if he

 does, the parole officer will get the pictures, and it's bye-bye, Orson.

 Karl, that's perfect! And then he'll have to let me go! I

 think someone deserves a kiss. Karl, we agreed. Bree, for the first

 time since we've been together, your husband is out of town. Do

 we really want to let that go to waste? Come on, come

 on! Do not answer that. This is Bree. Please leave a message.

 Damn it! - Hello! - Bree, you got to get that man

 out of your bedroom right now! What? There's no man in my

 room! Good, because it was just about to get a whole lot

 more crowded. Orson is home! Orson! You're home early. Is something wrong?

 Why are you back so soon? I'm coming down with a cold.

 You know how I hate to be sick away from home. What

 are you doing? There are two glasses downstairs and one has wine.

 You're obviously not alone here. What are you implying? You know perfectly

 well what I'm implying, Bree. Who was drinking the wine? Well, first

 of all, I am insulted that you'd even think that... Bree, where

 are you? There you are. Orson. Wow, I pop home for five

 minutes to toss some clothes in the dryer, and you've got a

 man in your bedroom. You were here tonight? Well, yeah, just tossing

 back a little vino and gossiping. Yes, this girl knows everything about

 everybody. Is there any wine left? I could use a glass. Yeah,

 downstairs on the table. You go on ahead. We're gonna finish up

 our girl talk. - Where are the clothes? - Behind the pillow.

 Hey. You're going to have to jump. There's rose bushes, so put

 your pants on first. - Angie, I can't thank you enough. -

 I didn't do this for you. - I did it for Orson.

 - For Orson? I defended you. I told him you had too

 much class to do something like this. I understand your disdain, but

 this is a complicated situation. Let me make it simple for you.

 Two men want you. Choose one. But which one? Orson's blackmailing me

 to stay with him. - He's manipulative and calculating. - Then go

 with lover boy. Well, what kind of life would I have with

 Karl? He's crass and conceited, and the only thing we seem to

 have in common is sex. Then why are you having an affair

 with someone you don't even like? Did I mention the sex? Karl

 brings out passion in me I never knew I had. I melt

 every time he touches me. Great. Then find a way out of

 your marriage and start building a life with this Karl. I would,

 it's just... What? Orson likes opera. - Hey, you busy? - No.

 So, did Gabby talk to you last night? No, but I need

 to talk to you. Oh? - I want you to run the

 Miami office. - What? If it isn't going to be Terrence, then

 it has to be you. The future of the company's at stake.

 I need my best people on the spot. It won't be forever,

 and depending on how things go, after a couple of years, maybe

 you could even move back and telecommute from here. - Carlos, what

 is this? - What's what? Come on! I know you know I'm

 pregnant. You're pregnant? Wow. Great. Carlos, please. I know Gabby told you.

 Nope. I would remember somebody telling me something like that. So, what's

 your answer? You send someone else to Miami, and I stay here.

 That's my answer. Except I need you in Miami, and I don't

 need you here. Not anymore. Carlos, I am sorry. I know I

 should have told you when I first found out. Believe me, I

 wish I had now, but you can't fire me for being pregnant.

 I'm not firing you, Lynette. I'm offering you a promotion. If you

 choose to turn it down and quit instead, I can't stop you.

 All I can do is say good luck and congratulations. No, it's

 late and I've still got to close up. Yeah, tomorrow's no good,

 either. Listen, you're a nice guy. I'm just not looking for a

 relationship right now. Sorry. Hello? I know you girls think that's letting

 a guy down easy, but trust me, it ain't. You okay for

 now? I've got to clean up in the back. Yeah, I'm good.

 Agent Padilla? Little memory quiz for you. This is Black Owl. Damn,

 Chris, still sharp as a tack, huh? No, no, no, no. Don't...

 Don't ask me anything, don't talk. This conversation will last less than

 60 seconds and we both know why. I'm thinking about coming in.

 You interrupt me again and I hang up. I said I was

 thinking about it. Now, here's what you need to think about. I

 don't care what happens to me, but I have to know she

 gets a pass. There'll be no further discussion on this until that

 is firm. The next time you hear from me, you will have

 an answer to that question, and it better be yes. You eavesdropping

 on me? No, no. I just got here. And now I want

 to go home. I'll see you. There is a coffee shop in

 Fairview. It's known as a place where you can read your morning

 paper, where you can meet your friends, where you can have a

 cup of coffee at the end of a long day. Yes, it

 was a place known for many things. Oh. Hey. Did you forget

 something? What are you doing? But after this night, it would be
