 ":"Previously

 on... Susan left town with a secret agenda. Where are you off

 to? I'm just visiting some family. Well, have a good trip. Carlos

 was headed back to rehab. You just worry about getting better. I

 can hold down the fort, no problem. Tom's trip with his girlfriend

 was encouraged. I think you should go to Paris. And Bree received

 another mysterious letter. It's always easy to know who our friends are.

 They're the ones who tell us when we look ridiculous... or when

 we're deluding ourselves... or when we've had enough. But only the best

 of friends will tell you the truth, even when they know... What

 the hell is this? It will upset you. That's what I found

 in my mailbox. \"You're welcome\"? I don't understand. Don't you recognize the

 stationery? It's the same as Mary Alice's letter, and I got it

 right after Chuck's funeral. You think this is who killed Chuck? Well,

 it's the only logical explanation. There's nothing logical about any of this.

 Don't you remember the first note? Yeah, whoever wrote that was threatening

 us. Exactly. So now all of a sudden, this person who \"Knows

 what we did\" and is \"Going to tell\" is now killing cops

 for us? Doesn't make sense. Yeah, but the timing. It is weird.

 So what's the deal with us? What do you mean? Are we

 still mad at each other? I think so. Okay. Just asking. Well,

 what are we gonna do about this? What can we do? We

 don't know who wrote it. We don't know what they want. We

 don't know what they're gonna do next. Is there anything we do

 know? Well... we know who these letters are being sent to. What's

 that supposed to mean? You're the one who keeps finding these things.

 You tell me. I don't like your accusatory tone. Well, I'd use

 a different tone, - but I'm trying to accuse you of something.

 - Gaby! You have to admit, Bree, there does seem to be

 a link between you and Mr. Creepy letter writing guy. I don't

 believe this. Why else would they keep sending you the notes? Why

 not send copies to all of us? This is not about me.

 And if you two are gonna just sit there and blame me

 for the actions of some psychopath, then... I'm just gonna go home.

 I say we forgive each other and just stay mad at Bree.

 Done. Yes, only your friends will tell you the truth. So when

 they warn you about someone suspicious, maybe you should listen to them.

 Susan Delfino was on a mission, and she had planned it down

 to the last detail. She brought the proper identification, she mapped out

 the correct route, and she brought plenty of cash for emergencies. But

 the one small detail she hadn't planned... was what to do once

 she got there. Mike, I've got a problem. Oh, what's wrong? You

 can't find the house? No, I'm standing in front of it right

 now. Then what's the problem? I have no idea how to get

 inside. You just spent an entire day on a plane. You didn't

 give this any thought at all? I was going to, and then

 I got caught up in an in-flight movie. It was about a

 dolphin who joins an inner city water polo team, and... Susan! Oh,

 my God. This was the stupidest idea ever, wasn't it? No, you

 did this because you're a good person. Honey, just leave some flowers

 and come back home. I can't. I came here for a reason.

 I have to make sure that Alejandro's family is okay. I just

 need to figure out some cover story to get in there. You're

 a little early! Oh, couldn't want to take the first look, could

 you? What? Oh, relax. I'm okay with early birds. Connie Thomas, Thomas

 realty. Officially, the open house doesn't start for an hour, but if

 you help me lay out the finger sandwiches, I'll let you sneak

 the first peek. Come on! Mike, I've gotta go. I'm about to

 buy a house. Listen, all I'm asking for is an extension. Once

 I get a model unit open, these condos are gonna be selling

 like crazy. Hi. What's going on? Hey, I was sitting over at

 Bree's, and I thought... I miss him. Yeah, I miss you, too.

 But I can get the numbers for you. Hold on. Here. Uh,

 did you hear me? I said I miss you. Uh, that's my

 girlfriend. Just... j... Hey. I don't miss people. I forget them. I

 ignore them. I verbally abuse them, but I am definitely not a

 missing-people kind of person. Can you hang on for a second? Listen,

 I love that you miss me, but I'm really busy right now.

 Talk later. Hey, you still there? Yeah, I've got the numbers right

 here. Yeah. Yeah. Let me tell you what the man from down

 under who will never again be down under just did to me.

 What's wrong? Nothing. Oh, god, it's like pulling teeth. I saw you

 talking to Gaby and Lynette. Did they say something to upset you?

 I don't want to discuss it. They suggested botox, didn't they? No.

 Why would you say that? You're having wine before lunch. That's what

 I did the first time someone said I needed botox. Yes, I

 am upset, but it's private, and I wanna process it... privately. Ohh,

 keeping stuff inside is how you ended up in that motel with

 a gun. Relax. I am no longer suicidal. You don't wanna talk?

 Fine. But I'm not gonna let you sit here for the next

 few days moping about god knows what. We're going out. What? I

 know all sorts of naughty places filled with all sorts of naughty

 men. Be ready to leave by 8:00 and try to wear something

 that doesn't scream \"Frigid schoolmarm.\" No! No, no, listen to me. I

 don't wanna go out. I don't wanna talk about my feelings, and

 I don't want you here anymore, so please... go home. Another glass

 of wine? It's just, I've never seen you drink. You know what?

 You're right. I could use a night out. Really? Yes, but my

 wardrobe is a bit frosty. Do you think you could run back

 to your house and find something in your closet for me? Something

 sexy. Absolutely. Oh, Bree, you'll see. A night out is exactly what

 you need to lift your spirits. I'm tired. I know, sweetie. Trying

 to teach you the value of hard work. If you're wondering why

 I'm pushing the leaves over to Ms. Kinsky's house, it's 'cause I'm

 trying to teach her the value of hard work, too. Mrs. Solis,

 hello. Hey... Carlos' secretary. Marilyn. Marilyn, of course. Yes. I knew that.

 What can I do for you, Marilyn? I was in the neighborhood,

 and I thought I'd bring by Mr. Solis' mail. - Thank you.

 - By the way, any chance that tomorrow he can get out

 of his... rehab? Why do you need Carlos? He's been trying to

 land this british firm as a client for months. They're in town

 for a couple of days, and I think a little wining and

 dining would seal the deal. Well, I don't think it's a good

 idea to spring Carlos out of rehab for \"Wining.\" Isn't there someone

 else who can meet with them? What about the old guy? Robert?

 He retired. Oh. Oh! How about the fat chick? Celeste? Maternity leave.

 The nerve of these people. Sorry, Marilyn. You win some, you lose

 some, right? Except in this case, we're losing a $90 million account.

 $90 million? And you think all it will take is a little

 wining and dining? Why don't you go ahead and set up that

 meeting? I have an idea. Okay, I'll get right on it. Do

 you know why the owners are selling? That's a bit of a

 scandal. I really shouldn't say. Okay. The husband disappeared four months ago,

 and he hasn't been heard from since. I think it's drugs or

 maybe another woman. Could be anything. Poor child. Stepchild. Oh, but you

 got the \"Poor\" part right. The wife had to take a second

 job, and now she still can't even make ends meet. Yeah. Tell

 the buyers how desperate we are. That'll jack up the sale price.

 Oh. Mrs. Sanchez, so sorry. I didn't realize you were coming back

 so soon. I bet. By the way, you dropped some of your

 flyers on my lawn. Oh, I should get those. Excuse me. It's

 not completely her fault. I was sort of... prying. Sorry. Are you

 sorry enough to buy my house? Oh, well, uh... actually, I was...

 looking for something a little larger. Well, that's too bad. Maybe, uh,

 there's something that I can do for you. Because... I am a

 collector of Americana... and some of your fabulous knickknacks have really caught

 my eye. I have fabulous knickknacks? You sure do. Like-like this, for

 instance. Those are Legos. I know what they are. But what you

 don't know is that these are... phase one Legos. Very rare. I

 would love to buy them if you're willing to sell. Seriously? 'Cause

 I got, like, a whole coffee can full of those. That's... jackpot.

 Oh! I-I, um, I will take them all. Hey, Marisa! What? This

 lady's buying all your old Legos. You still have that box full

 of headless barbies? Oh! Oh, that's okay. I'm good. Uh... here... is

 your check. Oh, I think you added an extra zero. That's because

 I... I wanna do something to help. You know, because of your...

 situation. Look, whatever my realtor said, you don't gotta feel sorry for

 me. I know my husband will come back. But... on the off

 chance that he... doesn't, please, take my check. Okay. Thank you. But

 stop giving me the sad eyes. Ramon does this sort of thing

 all the time. He goes on a little bender, then comes home,

 but mostly, he's a good husband and a loving father. Well, thank

 you again. It was a... pleasure doing business with you. You've really

 helped us out. Wow, that smells great. Where'd you learn to make

 a pot pie? I looked it up on a little place you

 kids call the internet. This is nice, huh? Perfect family dinner. It's

 doing it again. No, it's not. Everything's perfect. It's flickering, mom. Had

 to happen while dad was in Paris, right? Hey! What's that supposed

 to mean? I can handle it. I'll just do what your dad

 does. What does your dad do? He goes to the circuit box

 and... jiggles something. I can do that. You know exactly what he

 jiggles or... Never mind. I'll do it. Anything? - You're making it

 worse. - Wait, wait. This is it. This is definitely it. Well,

 it stopped flickering. What time is it in Paris? No. We are

 not going to call your dad. We just need some flashlights. Where

 does your dad keep the flashlights? Boss. Hi, Mike. Everything okay? Well,

 I, uh, I just bounced a check. Ouch. and it was to

 buy bats for M.J.'s little league team, so... - Embarrassing. - Exactly.

 So I called my bank to tear 'em a new one, and

 they told me my last paycheck was returned for insufficient funds... boss.

 Oh. Look, uh... Let me cover that for you. I'm sorry about

 that. I don't know what could have happened. I just switched banks.

 Maybe there was some kind of problem with the transfer. You sure

 that's it? I know the condo project's going a little slow. Is

 everything okay? Absolutely. Nothing to worry about. Here. Grab the kids a

 few extra bats. Oh, no, I don't need a tip. Uh, just-just

 my pay. Did you fix it? No, but I figured out it's

 not the light, so I'm going over the blueprints to find out

 where the real problem is. Or you could just call an electrician.

 Why do that? I went on the internet. I did a little

 research. And other than a few electrocution stories, it doesn't sound that

 hard. Seems like a lot of work. All dad had to do

 was... jiggle something. You know, the jiggle is just a band-aid. That

 was your dad's approach to everything. Just patch it up and pretend

 it's fixed. That's why we've had these problems all these years. The

 light. I'm talking about the light. At least the doorbell's working again.

 Hey! How are you? That's the \"Hey\" that means \"I need something.\"

 No, come on. This is important. Okay, Carlos is away, and I

 need some help with his business, and you're the only friend I

 have who knows this stuff. - What stuff? - I don't know.

 Some big british company. Bennett something. The Bennett group? Yeah! See? You

 get it. Anyway, they're on the verge of signing with Carlos, and

 since he's not \"Free,\" I thought I'd take 'em to dinner and

 close the deal. You? How would you even know what to talk

 about? Hey, that's where you come in. You used to work for

 Carlos. Maybe you can give me a few pointers. I have spent

 my life learning about the world of finance. I can't just teach

 it to you in a couple of weeks. Could you teach it

 to me in a couple hours? 'Cause the meeting's tomorrow. - Gaby.

 - I'm a fast learner, I swear. And from what I understand,

 the deal's as good as done. This is just a formality. Okay.

 Fine. Come back tonight after the kids are done. I'll do my

 best. - Oh, you're the greatest. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, could

 you at least bring... Bring some wine. I'm one step ahead of

 you. I was going to say Carlos' files. Oh, jeez. Those are

 at his office, and that's all the way across town. Hey! No.

 I don't suppose the bartender has any anti-bacterial wipes. You can ask

 again, but I don't think so. Will you stop? The fun of

 a place like this is getting germs on your elbows. I don't

 understand why anyone would want to come to a dive like this.

 You say \"Dive\" like it's a bad word. Look around. People are

 having fun. Now look in that mirror, hmm? Not fun. Why are

 you so uptight? Well, compared to you, a woman who paid for

 our drinks by... showing off the Bronte sisters. The Bronte sisters? Jeez.

 Even your boob jokes are repressed. What happened to you? Nothing happened

 to me. Well, someone made you this way. Was it your mother?

 My mother passed away when I was 10. Ohh. That explains it.

 Remember my mom died when I was a kid, too. When parents

 die, you can go one of two ways... Daddy's little girl or

 daddy's little nightmare. Well, I suppose my father did have certain expectations.

 He... raised me to be a lady, and I've done my best

 to make him proud. Mm, hello, repression. Well, I'm glad that he

 insisted on good behavior. Your dad is not here, Bree. No one's

 gonna tell him if you cut loose, have a little fun. You

 look hot in my dress. Be bad. Be naughty. Hit on a

 stranger. I wouldn't take a breath mint from these people... As if

 any of them would have one. Fine. Sit here alone like daddy

 wanted. I'm mad at Ben. I need to work out those issues

 with strange men on the dance floor. You're gonna leave me sitting

 here by myself? It's a dive, Bree. Dive in. The main thing

 that distinguishes you from a corporate firm is custom benchmarking. Let them

 know you provide superior customer service, even though your responsibilities are not

 fiduciary. Ooh, \"Fiduciary.\" I love how that sounds. Can you spell it

 for me? - Well, let me explain it first. - No, no,

 no, no, no. Your explanations take forever. Just spell it. Gaby, you

 can't write down a bunch of buzzwords and read them off a

 piece of paper at the meeting. Good point. I should hide a

 piece of paper. Or you could actually buckle down and learn the

 concepts. It's just fancy lingo. You throw it around. You sound smart.

 Clients are happy. I mean, who really understands this stuff? - Everybody.

 - Really? Everybody? Okay. Hey, Penny. What is \"Fiduciary\" mean? Um, I

 think it's like someone who's allowed to manage to someone else's money...

 like... a bank or something. Okay. Guess who's going to their prom

 alone. Look, can we take a break? We've been at this for

 hours. 43 minutes. Well, it feels like hours. Just give me a

 couple more smart words, and we'll be done. What happens when they

 have a question? You can't just spout off a bunch of terms

 you don't understand. Of course I can. You think when I was

 a spokesmodel at car shows I knew what rack and pinion steering

 was? I didn't have to, 'cause I had charm. And a tight

 little dress that barely covered your hoo-ha. I wonder if I still

 fit into that dress. Well, here's a thought. How about for once

 in your life you apply yourself? What does that mean? It means

 for as long as I've known you, you have been skating by

 on your looks and charm. For as long as you've known me?

 Wow, you've been holding on to that for a long time. Tell

 me I'm wrong. No, Lynette, I can't. No one can tell you

 you're wrong, 'cause you're always right. Okay. What does that mean? It

 means you're a know-it-all. I have never once heard you say the

 words \"I don't know.\" Well, get ready to, because I don't know

 why I agreed to help you. This is a complete waste of

 my time. It's a bigger waste of my time, 'cause listening to

 you, time goes slower. Good luck at your meeting. Yeah, well, thanks

 for nothing. What a fi-douche. - Hello. - Hi. Oh, lord. I

 was hoping you'd take it from there. I have absolutely no idea

 what to say next. Uh... sorry. Neither do I. Well, hey, look

 at that. We already have something in common. Hey. You using this?

 Well, it looks like we might have to make a commitment here.

 You ready to take that step? Sorry. I'm afraid this chair's taken.

 - I'm Bree, by the way. - Bradley. So what is a

 man wearing a custom-made suit doing in a place like this? Uh,

 well, actually, I'm not supposed to be in a place like this.

 I'm supposed to be across town at the four seasons attending my

 high school reunion. Oh, and you decided not to go. No, no,

 I went, for about, uh, six minutes. Ah, all these people full

 of regrets trying to recapture their glory days. I was about to

 blow my brains out. That sound crazy? Not as much as you

 might think. I sometimes think I married him just to lose my

 virginity. I've never said that to anyone. I can't believe I just

 told that to a total stranger. I don't know why everyone's so

 afraid of telling their secrets. It's freeing, isn't it? Yeah, you're right.

 You know, I think there's a lot of things I've been afraid

 of for no good reason, like pigeons and cilantro. Well, I don't

 have any pigeons or cilantro at my house. You know, I'm-I'm sorry.

 I-I bet you're too much of a lady to go home with

 somebody you just met at a bar. Yes, a lady usually likes

 to know a man a little bit longer. All right, that's long

 enough. Let's go. It's Marisa, right? Uh, I'm Susan. I don't know

 if you remember me from the open house. My mom's inside. I'll

 go get her. No, no, um, actually. I wanted to talk to

 you alone, if that's okay. Why? I, uh... I wanna ask you

 about your dad. Stepdad. Stepdad. Right. He wasn't a very good man,

 was he? When your mom mentioned him, I noticed the look on

 your face, and I had this feeling that maybe there was a

 problem between you two. I don't wanna talk about this. It's okay.

 I know him a little bit, enough to know... the kind of

 person he is. You can tell me. Did he ever hurt you?

 Why? I know that you just met me, and this must seem

 very strange. But I came here... because I know what he did.

 And even though I can't take away the pain, I can promise

 you one thing. Your stepfather will never hurt you again. How can

 you know that? I just know. He is never... coming back. I

 promise. Oh, my, a pool, too? I wish I'd known. I would

 have brought my bathing suit. This is wonderful, by the way. Yeah,

 it was one of my favorites. I picked it up on a

 wine tasting trip through the south of France last summer. It's got

 a nice... Well, I guess you like it, too. Oh, my goodness.

 I've never done anything like that before. Well, here's to trying new

 things. You know what? I just thought of something else I've never

 tried before. This is so crazy. I'm in a pool. I'm naked.

 And I love it. Well, get ready to love it even more.

 Our very own... floating bar. You know what? I just thought of

 something else I've never done in a pool before. Oh, crap. Did

 someone just break into the house? Yeah. Me. Is someone out there?

 What's happening? It's a funny story. He's my boss. I'm his assistant.

 We need to get out of here. You're an assistant? Aren't you

 over 40? Jeez, you're worse than those people at my reunion! Bradley?

 Mr. Jacobs, you'll be happy to know that I have watered your

 plants and picked up your suits. Oh, and your, uh, daughter called.

 What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry. I thought you weren't

 gonna be back till Monday. Oh, you two have a lot to

 talk about. Could I trouble you for a towel? So you thought

 in the meantime you could take over my house, my pool, my

 pants?! Speaking of clothes, I'd love to be wearing some from that

 pile right there. Who are you? Ooh. Uh, I can assure you,

 I never do this sort of thing. Just get out! You have

 a lovely, lovely home. Whoa, no, we're not done with that one

 yet. Don't know what to tell you. Lease hasn't been paid, and

 I got sent to take it back. Guy with the funny accent

 asked me to wait a half-hour while he meets with some, uh,

 bankers. Mike, hey. Private meeting. Yeah, do me a favor, bud. Step

 back outside. Are you crazy? Well, it's just a stop-gap loan. No

 worries. - Who is this guy? - Sorry, pal. The deal's off.

 He's not taking your money. If he's a friend, I suggest you

 urgently get the hell out of my face. Mike, I'm not asking

 you. I'm telling you. Mind your own business. Ben, when you're dead

 or on the lam because you can't pay them back, and trust

 me, you will never be able to pay them back... I'm gonna

 lose my job. That is my business. You can go. \"Mike,\" was

 it? Yeah. Yeah. Mike. My whole life, money's been the boot on

 my throat, you know? When I was a kid, when I was

 a young guy starting out, and even now when I'm supposedly some

 sort of a success. Yeah, it's a pain in the ass. Even

 Renee, as rich as she is, still complains about it. Yeah, yeah,

 she, uh, she divorced some athlete or something, right? Some athlete? Try

 Doug Perry. The New York Yankee. Oh. Sorry, mate. If she divorced

 a cricket player, I might recognize the name. If she divorced a

 cricket player, she wouldn't have gotten $12 million. Another? Uh... yeah. Yeah,

 yeah, another. Well, Gaby, we are very fond of Carlos and everyone

 at global, but help me out here. How can I tell our

 board we're going with your firm instead of a larger one with

 a longer track record? Four words... \"Open-architecture investment platform.\" So as opposed

 to tightly controlling our portfolio, you would open it up to a

 number of asset managers. Isn't that what I just said? So where

 do you see the greatest opportunity for growth? Five words... debt management

 and emerging markets. Yes, because the I.M.F. has vowed to support those

 economies. We like what we're hearing, Gaby. Two words... me, too. Oh.

 Sorry. It's my daughter. Juanita, I'm in a business meeting. Yes, I

 have business meetings. Since now. What do you want? No, you cannot

 give your sister a haircut. Oh, okay. Well, I'll fix it later.

 Just don't let her look in any mirrors. Sorry about that. Where

 were we? Well, I was just about to ask you your opinion

 of the long-term viability of the euro. Ah, well... Where's my menu?

 - The waiter took it. - What? Wait. We haven't even ordered

 yet. Oh, the chef is creating a tasting menu for us. Isn't

 that nice? No! No, no. I... need my menu. Come on. Gotta

 be in here. Reservation under commerson. Oh. Here. Sit wherever you want.

 Is there a problem, Gaby? No. Uh... No, no. No problem. Everything

 is fine. Enough business talk. Let's just eat. Oh, no, I love

 this stuff. In fact, I am going to pick your brain for

 the entire meal. Yay! So you were just about to tell us

 your feelings about the future of a unified european currency. Fiduciary. Hey,

 how was practice? Coach is an idiot. You still can't fix it?

 Well, I'm sure I could, but you know, I'm starting to like

 it that way. Gives the place ambiance. Mom! Like a flickering candle.

 Mom?! Can you come up here? Yes, honey? What did you do?

 I was trying to fix the light in the kitchen. And now

 my wall has a huge hole bashed in it? Hey, hey, don't

 get all high and mighty. There are several walls in this house

 That have huge holes bashed in them. And you thought I wouldn't

 notice if you... covered it with a unicorn poster? Well, Parker, you

 didn't notice when I was bald from chemo, so, yeah, it was

 worth a shot. Why is there a map of Canada on my

 wall? Oh, my god! I don't wanna see into his room! It's

 bad enough hearing what goes on in there. Shut up. I'm not

 the one who practices kissing with a stuffed dolphin. Hey, hey! Mom,

 what happened? I was looking for a thing called the secondary fuse

 box, which is supposed to be in the wall, but it turns

 out the internet can be wrong. Unbelievable. Mom, we told you two

 days ago, just call an electrician. No. No. I have to be

 able to figure this out. Your father is gone, and lots of

 things like this are going to happen, and I need to know

 how to fix them. If I had known he was going to

 really leave, then I would have had him teach me this stuff

 while he was still here! I... should go get dinner ready. I'm

 sorry. I don't have time for you right now. I'm on the

 phone. I don't see a phone. Yeah. It's just my boyfriend. She'll

 call you back. I'm sorry. And no matter how busy I was,

 I should've made time for you. How much did the wine cost?

 $115. Okay, you're sorry. I gotta be honest. I was worried you

 were losing interest in me. Lose interest in you? Renee... you got

 everything a man could want. I'm busy. Too busy for Bourbon? Or

 ice cream? Hey, we can make a Bourbon float. Okay. Terrible idea.

 I just came to say you were right. I am a pain-in-the-ass

 know-it-all, and I am sorry. You were right, too. Bourbon float's a

 terrible idea. But an Amaretto float... It's just so typical. You came

 to me for help, but instead, I gave you a lecture, and

 when you wouldn't do what I said, - I kicked you out.

 - It's okay. No, it's not. I have been doing this to

 Tom forever... till he got fed up and left. I really don't

 want that to happen with my friends, too. Honey, I deserved it.

 You're right. I do fake my way through life by batting my

 eyes and looking pretty. And the problem is, I can't do that

 anymore. Right. Because you're getting older. No, 'cause Carlos is gone. Oh,

 sorry. I just have all these responsibilities. I have to grow up.

 Well, he should be back in a few weeks. What if he

 isn't? What if he can't kick this thing? Then I'm gonna be

 on my own, and I am helpless on my own. And that's

 why I came to you. I just wanted someone to take care

 of things so I wouldn't have to. I wanted you to be

 my Carlos. I just miss him so much. I miss Tom, too.

 But at least we have each other. We're gonna get through this.

 How do you know? Because... I know everything, remember? Hey. You look

 exhausted. I am. I was gonna sleep on the plane, but... But

 they had a movie about a parrot that coaches an inner city

 debate team? Hey, I haven't heard that in a while. It's nice.

 Oh, this trip, Mike... it did what I needed it to do.

 Oh, I'm glad. Yeah. I think this whole Alejandro nightmare is finally

 over. Please don't cancel the card. My husband's been out of town,

 but I have some money now, and I can make the minimum

 payment tomorrow. Thank you. Marry a rich man, Marisa, because the only

 thing guaranteed in life is that the bills will never stop. Maybe

 you should sell his motorcycle. Your stepfather loves that thing. He'd kill

 me. But... what if he never comes back? Of course he's coming

 back. Why would you even say that? Did he contact you? No.

 Then what? Tell me. That woman who bought all that stuff... She

 came to talk to me. It was weird, but she promised he'd

 never come back. How would she know? That's what she said. And

 she seemed pretty sure about it. Turns out the car was his

 boss', too. I had to walk a mile and a half to

 the bus stop. Have you ever taken a bus at 1:00 in

 the morning, Renee? It makes you stop believing in god. Okay, Bree,

 I get it. And did I mention that I was soaking wet?

 Three times. Good, because I wanna be very clear just how your

 advice worked out. Can I say something? I... think you had a

 blast. Why would you say that? I can see it in your

 eyes. You're telling me about this horrible story, but you love telling

 it. That is... ridiculous. Although... I suppose it was... a little exhilarating.
