 ":"Previously

 on... Keith moved in with Bree. Susan came to grips with her

 future. Dialysis until they find me a donor. - Well, that won't

 take very long, will it? - Three to five years. In grief

 over losing her biological daughter... Grace no longer exists, and that is

 the last time you will mention her name in this house! Gaby

 sought comfort from an unusual source. - And there were some surprises...

 - Somebody lose a gun? Including a long lost son... - You

 didn't mention your mother-in-law. - My mother-in-law? And a shocking revelation for

 Paul. Felicia Tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths to cause you

 harm. Paul Young had made a discovery... his wife was a liar.

 She had lied with every smile, with every caress, and with every

 kiss. Yes, Paul now knew their entire marriage was a fraud. The

 only thing he didn't know... Hey there. Was how he would punish

 her. You're packing? I thought you weren't coming home until tomorrow. I

 talked the doctor into letting me out early. I'm glad. I really

 need you right now. Things on the street have been getting very

 strange. Beth, things on that street have always been very strange. Well,

 yes, but... Remember I told you how Bree was inviting me over

 - for drinks with the other women? - And I told you

 not to go. Well, I should've listened. Turns out they're trying to

 frame me. Frame you? While I was there, I found a gun

 under my sofa cushion. It was a 38... The same caliber the

 police said you were shot with. They must've planted it there. -

 And the gun just magically appeared? - Yes. I'm sure Bree's going

 to turn it over to the police, and they're going to think

 I shot you. Beth... you don't have to worry about what anyone

 else thinks. I know the truth. Hey, here's an idea. Why don't

 we take a trip? A trip? We need to get away. We'll

 go somewhere... secluded. Ohh. That sounds like heaven. Yes... Paul had no

 choice but to punish his wife... I love you. Because some lies...

 are unforgiveable. We are reminded every spring... with every rose that blooms,

 with every sunflower that blossoms, with every lily that buds. The world

 is a beautiful place. Sadly, it is filled with people who do

 ugly things... Constantly. That woman who just drove away... who was she?

 Uh... a friend. You're friends with Barbara Fairchild, the interior designer? Bob?

 Or should I say, the inferior designer? Hey, Renee. How could you

 hire Barbara Fairchild when you know I just started my own interior

 design firm? Uh... we're not hiring her. Oh? Why you holding swatches?

 And people think you're the smart one. Look, you know we just

 adopted a little girl. Well, we hired Barbara to decorate her room.

 - Well, why not hire me? - You're not exactly maternal. We-we

 wanted this room to be pink and nurturing, and your style seems

 more like chrome and glass and... teeth. Look who's back to being

 the smart one. Look, Fairchild is a hack. Whatever she quoted you,

 I'll come in 2 days earlier and 20% cheaper. - Barbara is

 kind of expensive. - Done. I'll get started right away. Just so

 you know, our daughter gets here in a week. And just so

 you know, I'm as maternal as the next woman. Gaby? Hi, honey.

 You want some lunch? No, I want an explanation. I just got

 our credit card bill. $840 at Miss Charlotte's doll academy? Did I

 say lunch? I meant sex. Do you want some sex? Why are

 you buying our kids fancy toys? Last week, Juanita used her doll's

 leg to scrape peanut butter out of the jar. Okay, the doll

 wasn't for Juanita. It's for... Bob and Lee, for the little girl

 they're adopting. You spent $800 on a gift? It made me feel

 good, okay? For the first time in weeks, I'm not staying in

 bed till 2:00 in the afternoon or staying up all night sobbing.

 So I went a little crazy on the credit card. - Just

 let me be happy. - But $800?! Carlos, if you get this

 worked up now, you'll have no place to go when the bill

 for the platinum card comes in. Uh, excuse me? Hi. I'm looking

 for Keith Watson. His roommate told me he moved here. Uh, yes,

 but he's not available at the moment. Can I give him a

 message, miss... Sorry. I'm Amber James. I just need to talk to

 him about something. It's kind of important. Well, I would be happy

 to tell him what it's regarding if you... tell me... what it's

 regarding. We're just... old friends. I'm at the Fairview motor inn. Could

 you ask him to come by? Why exactly would he be doing

 that? You're... kind of a nosy landlady, aren't you? I'm not his

 landlady. I'm his girlfriend. So he... lives here with you? Yes. Yeah,

 of... of course he does. Of course he does. Are you all

 right? Um, yeah, I'm fine. You know what? Don't even, uh, don't

 even tell him I came by. There's no message. Sorry to disturb

 you. Okay, you're all set. The dialysis will take six hours. -

 If you need anything, just hit the call button. - Will do.

 Hi. Hi. I'm Susan. It's my first time in here. Dick. Sounds

 like you've been coming here for a while. Four years. Any tips

 for a newbie? Like, which nurse has the shakes or where do

 they hide the good painkillers? Look, nothing personal, but I don't want

 to be your dialysis buddy. I wanna sit here and play scrabble

 on my phone while this... while this machine washes my blood. So

 you don't want to talk or be friendly or keep each other

 company? Sad, isn't it? You know, Dick... sometimes when I meet people,

 they say, \"you don't seem like a Susan.\" But you... Why are

 you putting out those ugly candlesticks? Oh. Who gave them to me?

 Yay! Grandma's coming. Yep, and your brother just pulled up with her.

 This could be your last chance to run screaming from the room.

 Why? I love grandma. I do, too, sweetie. It's just... I can

 only take her in small doses, and unfortunately, your grandma doesn't come

 in small doses. Hey! Easy over the threshold! You're not transporting meat.

 Okay, grandma, enjoy your visit. She's going back in a cab. Mom!

 Hi! Oh, my gosh! What happened to your foot? Oh, I-I broke

 it a month ago. Uh, thanks for checking in. Oh, I'm sorry.

 We've just been so busy, and... Penny, look, your grandma's here. Give

 her a kiss. Hey, look at you. You're getting buds! Be thankful

 she didn't yell it to you as you were getting on the

 bus. So... uh, what's new? Well... actually, um, I started an interior

 design business. Do you remember my friend Renee? I'm getting married. What?

 Married? To who? Frank Kaminski. We met in water aerobics at the

 retirement community. Only man in the pool. I was lucky to get

 him. This is kind of a shock. I didn't even know you

 were dating. So... when's the wedding? Saturday. This saturday? Uh, and you're

 just telling me now? Well, maybe if you visited - more often...

 - More often. I know. I know. So... do I get to

 meet him? I mean, if you're going to make this kind of

 commitment... What? You wanna make sure his intentions are honorable? Lynette, I

 hate to break this to you. I am not a virgin. Mom...

 I want to meet him. All right, come by tomorrow, and we'll

 squeeze you in between \"Nothing to do\" and \"Waiting for death.\" -

 Are you all right? - What? You were yelling in your sleep.

 Really? Yes, you were shouting out, \"Amber! Amber!\" what could that mean?

 I'm... I'm doing a painting job. I'm thinking about, uh... Shades of

 yellow that go in the kitchen. Nope. Definitely not a color. Sounded

 like a name... Amber. Know anyone by that name? I once had

 a girlfriend named Amber. Did you? And at this time I'd like

 to point out that dreaming of an old girlfriend is not cheating.

 Well... when was this? You never told me about her. I-I don't

 know. Seven years ago? Seven years? Was it serious? We lived together...

 for, uh, three years. So you were in love with her. Well...

 yeah, until she left me. So she left you. You miss her?

 I tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart.

 Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back to sleep so

 I can dream about you. It's so great visiting a retirement village...

 2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped. Hey, mom. Mwah. Lynette... This is

 Frank. It is so nice to meet you, Frank. Call me \"dad.\"

 Wouldn't it be awful if I was that guy? So... Frank, um,

 I've just been dying to meet you, and... Just a sec. Hey,

 muchacho. We've been waiting ten minutes for our menu. What do I

 got to do to get you to hurry it over, build a

 fence? Hey, it's a menu, not a high school diploma. I'm sure

 you can find one somewhere. Oh, yeah. You were saying something? Lynette's

 been dying to meet you. She has so many questions. Oh, go

 ahead. I got time to kill while I'm waiting for Pancho Villa

 to get my menu. Okay. Uh... I was just wondering, what made

 you decide to propose to my mother? I love her. What do

 you think? Aw. What a short... angry story. Frank... is very to

 the point. That's what first attracted me to him. - Oh. -

 What else you need to know? Um, have you ever been married

 before? Three times... two dead and two left me. Oh, wait a

 minute. That's four. Yeah, then make it four. Now... you done grilling

 me? Yes. I think I've learned everything I need to know. -

 Hi, Gaby. - Hey, Karen. I wanted to get the name of

 that chinese place you and Roy are always raving about. Come on

 in. I'll get you the address. Carlos is a little grumpy -

 since the credit card bills came in. - Hmm. I figured a

 little M.S.G. should calm him down. I've got a menu here somewhere.

 I never noticed that before. What? That doll. Oh, Adelaide. Heck, I've

 had her since forever. She was my best friend growing up. I

 couldn't bear to toss her, so there she is. I didn't know

 you were into dolls. I'm not really into them. Oh! Here's the

 menu. Where did, uh, that come from? I carry her around with

 me. You do? Mm-hmm. Her name's princess Valerie. Oh! Look! They could

 be sisters. Okay. Oh, I have an idea. Miss Charlotte's doll academy,

 where I got Valerie, has this tearoom. It is beautiful. All of

 us should go sometime. By all of us, you mean the dolls?

 Of course. Should I make a reservation? Well... maybe. I'm kinda curious

 to see where this all goes. - Here. - Thanks. Oh, no!

 What's wrong? I said \"No mayo,\" Like, 15 times. I'll trade with

 you. Do you want my salad? Uh, let me check. Nope, still

 got a penis. I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.

 - I'll get you a new one. - I got tee time

 in ten minutes. So go! It'll be waiting for you at the

 condo, wrapped in foil, with an ice cold beer when you get

 there. You're... you're so good to me. See you at the wedding,

 Lorraine. So what do you think? Well, he's quite a... I wouldn't

 even know where to... Okay, he's gone. - How can you marry

 that jerk? - Lynette! I mean it. He's abrasive, obnoxious, borderline racist...

 No, he crossed the border of racist. He lives in racist. You

 cannot seriously love him. I don't. You... you don't? Then why are

 you marrying him? Because he's loaded, and he hates his kids, and

 he's got a bad ticker. And when he kicks the bucket, I

 get everything. You're marrying him for his money? Please. I married for

 love three times and ended up brokenhearted and piss-poor. And by the

 way, he's getting something out of this, too. You wanna know how

 I really broke my foot? Paul? What are you doing up? Is

 everything all right? Couldn't sleep. I've just been... sitting here, thinking. About

 what? I have so much hatred inside me... from my neighbors who

 betrayed me... for my son who disowned me. For whoever tried to

 kill me. I'm tired of hating people, but I don't know how

 to stop. What a thing to say. Stop being so hard on

 yourself. You're a decent man. You just need to focus on what's

 good in your life. What is that again? Well, for starters, me.

 I do think about you... all the time. From the first moment

 I met you, all I wanted was for you to love me.

 And... here we are. Here we are. You're just tired. Come back

 to bed. All right. Tomorrow we can talk about our trip. We

 need to decide where we're going. Yes, about that... I booked us

 a cabin in the woods. Cabin? Oh, that sounds... rustic. I need

 to go somewhere far away where nobody can find us. Okay. You

 can be happy, Paul. You just need to identify what's negative in

 your life... and then get rid of it. That sounds like a

 plan. Hey, Karen. Gaby's in the kitchen. Actually, I wanna talk to

 you about Gaby. How's she doing lately? Well, you know, we went

 through kind of a rough patch, but I think she's coming around

 now. Yeah? Well, think again. Girls, dinner's ready! I made your favorite...

 What are you doing here? Gaby. Aah! Jeez! You scared me. This

 wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it? Why'd you lie

 to me? Because I knew you wouldn't understand. You spent $800 on

 a doll for yourself. Y-you're right. I-I don't understand. Oh, please. Like

 this is any crazier than your collections. A steroid freak hits a

 baseball over a fence, and you paid thousands of dollars for it.

 Yeah, well, I don't carry it around with me - or take

 it to tea. - Okay, first of all, Mrs. McCluskey has a

 big mouth. Second, the doll makes me happy. What do you care?

 Gaby, I want you to be happy, but this is not about

 a doll. You know what? I don't want to talk about this

 anymore. This is clearly about Grace. No! No! No! We're not supposed

 to talk about her! That was your rule! I'm going to get

 ready for dinner. Hey, Susan. I kept her warm for ya. Thanks,

 Ethan. Hey, how was your history final? Aced it. Thank you for

 studying with me. - No problem. I'll see you thursday. - Yeah.

 Ahem. Scrabble. Look, I know you don't wanna talk, but I thought

 it would be more fun to play with me than with your

 phone. Thanks, but I'll take the phone. You know, this whole experience

 is miserable and isolating enough. I don't understand why you wanna make

 it worse by ignoring someone who's going through the same ordeal. Susan,

 did you ever see the old war movie where the fresh young

 kid comes in all bright-eyed, and the old vet won't give him

 the time of day? I hate war movies. Okay. What about the

 one where the girl moves to a different town, and the mean

 cheerleader at her new school doesn't wanna hang out with her? Go

 on. I'm the mean cheerleader. Okay? And I'm letting you know we're

 not going to be friends. You know, I can see why you're

 frustrated. Waiting for a transplant is brutal. I-I get that. But that

 doesn't mean that you can't try to stay positive while you wait

 for the good news. The good news? When this beeper goes off,

 that means someone died. That's what we're waiting for... for some poor

 son of a bitch who didn't use a helmet or a seat

 belt to die. We're waiting for a doctor to ask a family

 who, moments earlier, lost someone they loved to let them harvest their

 organs. And then we're waiting to see who gets them. That's what

 we do. We wait for tragedy and then cross our fingers that

 it's us they wake up at 2:00 in the morning with the

 good news. Susan... I know your intentions are good, but you don't

 have to distract me or entertain me or comfort me. I wasn't

 trying to comfort... you. - Hi, Amber. - What are you doing

 here? Well, you seemed so upset when you came over, and obviously

 it involves Keith, or you wouldn't have come looking for him, and

 so naturally I'm concerned. Everything's fine. It's not a big deal. Anyway,

 I'm... sort of in the middle of packing, so... Mommy, I can't

 find my ball. Charlie, I'll be with you in a second, okay?

 How old is Charlie? 6. Keith and I would be great for

 a while and then not so great. I had actually moved out

 before I realized I was pregnant. So why didn't you tell Keith?

 I had actually decided to give up the baby, and I knew

 he would try and talk me out of it. Then I changed

 my mind the moment I saw Charlie. After that, it just never

 felt right to come back and ambush him with a kid. And

 yet... here you are, ambushing. It's just... Charlie is at that age

 where he's starting to ask a lot of questions, and I'm running

 out of ways to be vague. So Charlie is the only reason

 you came? Okay. Maybe I... was kind of wondering if Keith would

 still be... But I'm glad he's happy. You seem really great. I

 know I owe it to Charlie to tell Keith. It's just... I

 don't think I can do it. Would you like me to? You

 would do that? I think I have to. Now, it's not exactly

 finished yet. I'm still waiting on a few pieces, and the curtains

 are on back order. Don't worry. I'm sure it's amazing. But you

 did keep the receipts, right? Oh, my god. It's exactly the room

 I wanted when I was growing up. I mean, the only thing

 that's missing is... baby unicorns! So... you like it? Oh, we love

 it. Thank you, Renee. It's everything we'd hoped for. How did you

 put this together so quickly? Oh, it was easy. I've been thinking

 about this room for 20 years. Really? There was a time when

 I thought I might have kids. I used to imagine the kind

 of room I'd want my daughter to have. Mm. Right down to

 the last detail. I never knew you thought about kids. Well, that

 was a long time ago. It's never too late. Heck, if we

 can adopt... Excuse me. I've gotta find that painter. This is not

 the color we agreed on for the trim. I can't do it.

 I can't be a party to this. I can't wheel her down

 the aisle to marry some jackass she doesn't even love. Lynette, you

 have to do this. Besides, you know, think of what's at stake

 now. What are you talking about? Well, you know, how can I

 put this delicately? I mean, today your mother has money. Someday soon

 she will die. The day after that, Tom and Lynette have money.

 That's a horrible thing to say. Well, just saying, you've always wanted

 to put Paige in private school, and I've always wanted to know

 what it's like to sleep on a yacht. You're lucky you're holding

 the baby. Lynette, in all seriousness, it's your mother's wedding day. If

 you don't support her, you're gonna ruin your relationship. Lynette! Yeah? They're

 playing my song. Are you ready to wheel me down? Lynette! Lynette!

 Lynette! What are you doing? Okay, here's the thing. I can't let

 you do this. Who asked you? You can't marry an obnoxious jerk

 like that. Mom, you want me to visit more often? That is

 never gonna happen if you're with him. And think about the example

 you are setting your grandchildren... marrying a guy for his money. Now,

 look, Tom and I have a little savings... Lynette, I know Frank's

 a bit of an acquired taste. But... he needs me. Nobody needs

 me anymore. Your sisters are always busy. I never see you. I

 try to see you as much as I can, but... I know.

 Your family needs you. And Frank... needs me. Why didn't you tell

 me this? Why did you let me think it was all about

 the money? I guess it was easier to say that than to

 admit how... useless and... lonely I feel. Okay. Hello? We're trying to

 have a wedding out here. Oh, sorry! My daughter doesn't think you're

 good enough for me. She's right. Now hurry it up. This church

 is in one of those ethnic neighborhoods, and I'm worried about the

 car. Renee, there is someone we'd like you to meet. This is

 our daughter. - Hello. - We just picked her up from the

 airport, and we wanted you to be the first person on the

 lane to meet her. Oh, you didn't have to do that. We

 know. I think I'm gonna start getting her settled in. - Say

 good-bye to Mrs. Perry. - Bye. Come on. She's absolutely precious. Yeah.

 We're very lucky. Listen, can I ask you for a favor? Lee,

 you know I don't like sentences that start that way. Bob and

 I have been thinking, and even though I know we are gonna

 be great fathers, there may be times that Jenny needs to talk

 to a woman about... stuff. And on those rare occasions, I was

 wondering if we could bring her over here. Well... sure. Great. I

 will go tell our daughter that if she needs anything, she can

 count on her old auntie Renee. And if she ever calls me

 \"Old auntie,\" I will kick her. Got it. Sorry. Those are beautiful,

 Susan. Thank you, Ethan. Don't worry. They're not for you. They're for

 people who still possess an ounce of humanity. Whatever you say, Pollyanna.

 But if I see any mylar balloons with-with dogs wearing stethoscopes, I'm

 filing a complaint. Why are you always so miserable? It's called anger,

 Susan. I'm sure you have it, too, right underneath that \"Hang in

 there, kitty\" smile. - Hey, Dick, take it easy. - It's okay,

 Ethan. Fine. You're angry. The rest of us aren't. So stop dragging

 us into your circle of self-pity. Ugh. Come on. It's me. I'm

 so happy for you. Thank you. I gotta go call my mom.

 Yeah. Ready, Susan? Yes. Actually, um, i-if it's okay, I'm gonna... sit

 over here today. Sure. What are you doing? Leaving a note for

 the gardener. If he has any more problems with those sprinklers, I

 want him to know that we'll be at the cabin. Oh. Good

 idea. Beth, I think we should bring some extra blankets. It might

 get cold. Would you mind grabbing a couple? Not at all. Detectives.

 Everything okay? I'm sure your wife told you a gun was recently

 discovered at Bree van de Kamp's house. Yes, apparently it was the

 same caliber that I was shot with. Bree seems to think your

 wife planted it there, hoping to implicate some of her friends in

 your shooting. What an imagination she has. So you've never seen this

 before? Mr. Young? Yes. You seemed to have quite a reaction there.

 I'm not comfortable around firearms, that's all. Well, just to be clear,

 you do not believe this belongs to your wife. Detectives, I know

 for a fact this is not Beth's gun. Good day. Should we

 take two blankets or three? Forget the blankets. The trip's off. What?

 Why? I got a call. There's a problem with the cabin. Oh,

 shoot. And I was so looking forward to it. Trust me, Beth.

 I think you dodged a bullet here. Mmm. I don't know what

 you do to this chicken, but it's the best thing that I've

 ever had. Mmm. So I, um, stopped by Bob and Lee's house.

 They're so excited about finally becoming fathers. Which got me to thinking,

 I know you had said that you were okay with not being

 able to have a child. Is that... still the case? Uh, yeah.

 That didn't sound very convincing. It's kind of a weird question. Okay,

 well, let me rephrase it. If you had the chance to be

 a father, would you take it? Bree, where is this coming from?

 I thought we dealt with this. Well, I just wanna make sure.

 I don't want you to see Bob and Lee with their child

 and start to have regrets. What do you want me to say?

 All right, there was a time in my life when I thought,

 yeah. Yeah. I'd love to be a dad, but then I met

 you. I'm just saying... if you had the choice... I don't. This

 is really good chicken. So? I'm sorry. He doesn't even wanna meet

 Charlie? Well, you have to understand that after six years, Keith feels

 that it would be too difficult for everyone. Why did I wait

 so long? Again, I am so sorry. Oh, no. You don't have

 to do that. Please. Keith and I feel that we really need

 to do something. So please... take it. Sorry. I had to show

 the sitter how to work the TV. Now where is this chinese

 pl... aah! You put her in a car seat? Oh. Well, she's

 expensive, and the way you drive... Honey, I've been thinking. Maybe we

 should go see a therapist together. I don't need a therapist. I

 think you do. Maybe I haven't been fair to you. But you

 do really need to talk to someone about this. Carlos, I'm not

 crazy. Well, then should I change the reservation to three? Don't be

 ridiculous. She's not gonna sit with us. She fits right in my

 bag. This doesn't look like a place you'd put a restaurant. No,

 it looks like a place you'd bury a body. Will you please

 just put the address - into the navigation system? - For the

 tenth time, I don't need it. - I know where Oak Park

 is. - Carlos, I'm starving! I will not think you're weak if

 you use a navigation system! Fine. I'll use it. I'd much rather

 listen to that annoying voice than that one. What's the address? -

 Okay. It's 1-1-9... - Get out of the car! Oh, god! Okay,

 okay, take it easy, man. Now! Get out. We're doing it. Be

 cool. Uh, can you hold on? - What do you mean, hold

 on?! Get the hell out of the car! - Gaby! I gotta

 get my baby! Oh, crap. Just... - It's a doll! What are

 you trying to pull, bitch?! - Oh, god. - Get out before

 I put a bullet in you! - No! Gaby! Get out! -

 I can't get the buckle! - Gaby, come on! I can't get

 the buckle! I can't get the buckle! Get... uhh! No! Ohh! My

 baby! My baby! My baby! My baby! Gaby! It's not Grace! Whoa.

 What are you doing to your roses? Pruning them. Looks like you're

 killing them. I know it looks bad, but sometimes you have to

 be ruthless if you want something beautiful to keep growing. The world

 is filled with people who do ugly things. Why do they act

 this way? Some lie to keep from losing what they love. Some

 lash out because they fear the future. Some put up walls because

 they have regrets. Yes, everyone has a reason for the ugly things

 they do... and once we find out why... then we can try
