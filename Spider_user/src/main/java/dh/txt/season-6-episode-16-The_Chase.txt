 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. All right, I love you! There, I said it.

 Feelings were stated boldly. I think it's time for me to give

 up on men. You could always just do what I did. A

 romantic suggestion was made... - Date chicks. - Oh. ...and a plan

 was hatched... He wants to represent you. They want you in New

 York immediately. ...to break up a romance. This is a huge opportunity.

 The best part is, she is miles away from the nearest Bolen.

 But young love couldn't be stopped. Since she'd become a mother, Gabrielle

 Solis had learned many things. How to get gum off of a

 remote control, how to rescue a doll from the disposal, and where

 to find disappointing report cards. Gabrielle had also learned that no matter

 how hard she tried... Cereal again? ...she couldn't please everyone. Yes, another

 free meal you didn't have to work for. It's tough being seven.

 Celia, get down here! Ana used to make us bacon. I miss

 her. Yeah, well, she also used to do the laundry and the

 windows, so I miss her more. Celia, the milk is poured! -

 I need cupcakes for school today. - Today? How many? - Mom...

 - Three dozen. - Why didn't you tell me this last night?

 - I forgot. We got any ham? I need meat. Babe, are

 you gonna pick up my suit from the dry cleaners? Yes, after

 I fold the laundry, fry up some ham, and pull three dozen

 cupcakes out of my ass. - Mom! - What? My face itches.

 - What are those, mosquito bites? - Whoa, that looks like chicken

 pox. No, no, no, no! I don't have time for sick kids.

 Forget the dry cleaning. You've got to take her to the doctor.

 Oh, God. What do you do for chicken pox? - I never

 had them. - What? Stop! - Why? - You can't go anywhere

 near her. If you haven't had them, you're not immune. - In

 fact, you got to get out of here. - Honey, Celia is

 sick. Chicken pox is dangerous for adults. Go. I have to do

 the laundry, I've got dishes... I will take care of the house.

 Yes, Gabrielle had learned many things as a mother. The most important...

 See you. ...was to get while the getting was good. Seduction. Any

 soap opera fan will tell you it's an art best practiced... Stop!

 ...on those who are vulnerable. Hey, there. You hungry? I am now.

 What's that amazing smell? Cinnamon brioche French toast. But I probably shouldn't.

 You're such an amazing cook, I'm already having trouble fitting into my

 clothes. You need some maple syrup. Seriously, you heated the syrup? You

 are unbelievable. You should eat it while it's still hot. Mmm. Oh,

 no. Look, I just got syrup all over me. I don't know

 what it is with me. I just have to get dirty. You

 got some on your bra, too. Oh. I'll get it. Please, it's

 wrong. Then why does it feel so right? Katherine? You up yet?

 Oh, good. I was calling, but you didn't hear me. I think

 you fell asleep with the TV on. So, what would you like

 for breakfast? Anything but French toast. I don't think you'll be here

 that long. I got it. I got the perfect name for the

 baby. - Patricia. - Let me think about it... No. Why not?

 It's a great name. I told you, I want to honor my

 aunt. We're naming her Polly. Polly. Okay. You get a peg leg,

 I'll get an eye patch, and we'll carry her around on our

 shoulders. - Morning, Penny. - Hey, baby. Where are my pancakes? Sweetie,

 I've got a lot going on today. I'll make you pancakes this

 weekend. But I always get pancakes on my birthday. That's right, you

 do. But... We have an even bigger treat planned for you this

 year. What? Like I'm gonna tell you and ruin the big surprise.

 How could you forget her birthday? Me? I'm pregnant. I forget pants

 sometimes. What's your excuse? What's my surprise? - What the hell are

 we gonna do? - Cover me, I'm going in. Birthday breakfasts are

 for kids. Now that you're 11, I was planning to make you

 the best birthday dinner ever with decorations, tons of presents, pin the

 tail on the... You forgot my birthday. Wow. There was no covering

 that, babe. You're twice the man he is. What's Raymundo gonna say

 when he finds out Tiffany is sleeping with his brother? Alas, you'll

 never know. Hey, Mom. We were just taking a break. So I

 gathered. If you don't mind, Tad, I'd like to speak to my

 son. - Sure, go ahead. - In private, Tad. - Oh, so

 you want me to... - Be anyplace else but here. Right. -

 So what's up? - There's a truck outside with the flower arrangements

 we ordered for the Adams party, all 100 of them. - Wait,

 but we only ordered 10. - That's what I said. And then

 the delivery man showed me this invoice. At first I wasn't sure

 if that was Tad's signature. But when I saw that his name

 was misspelled, I knew it was him. - Would you like me

 to talk to him? - No. I would like you to hold

 him down while I strike him with a large wooden spoon. Whatever.

 I'll take care of it. What are you gonna say to him?

 Look, when Orson had his accident, did you or did you not

 put me in charge? Yes, but I'm starting to think that you

 are not ready. Look, I'm never gonna figure this job out unless

 you let me make mistakes and learn from them. I realize that,

 Andrew, but you're making... Mom, I know you have your control issues.

 But when stuff happens, you're gonna have to learn to just relax

 and let me clean up my own messes, okay? Hey, where do

 you want all these flower arrangements? Oops. No problem, Tad. As luck

 would have it, we've got extra. Roy, we've got guests. You can

 watch your soap later. Come on, Roy. Again, thank you for inviting

 us over to brunch. - Everything looks delicious. - Yeah, it does,

 doesn't it? All right, Karen. You know what I want. When company

 comes over, I get to use salt. Roy's on a low-sodium diet.

 \"Low-sodium\" is code for \"tastes like socks.\" So sue me 'cause I

 don't want you dropping dead. Listen to you two. You sound like

 a sweet, old married couple. So, have you ever thought of making

 an honest woman out of Karen? What are you doing? I just

 want them to be as happy as we are. We're happy. Living

 in sin suits us just fine. - Is that how Karen feels?

 - Susan, why don't you try this frittata? Karen doesn't care about

 marriage. Do you, pumpkin? Here. Have some more salt. I always figured

 you'd say no. So, why don't you grow a pair and find

 out? Are you serious? Of course she's serious! Fine. Mike, give me

 a hand, will you? Oh, my God. This is so romantic. Karen,

 will... Son of a bee, there's the battery to my hearing aid.

 Okay, okay. Karen, you want to marry me? Golly, I don't know

 what to say. This is all so sudden. Answer. My knee hurts.

 I would love to marry you, Roy. Yes! So if Gabby's just

 staying a couple of days, why'd she bring three suitcases? She said

 most of her dresses haven't had chicken pox either. Oh, that was

 amazing. I just took a nap in the middle of the day.

 I guess it's a little different without kids, huh? Are you kidding

 me? I haven't taken a nap since Juanita crowned. Okay, you just

 created a visual that is forbidden inside these walls. Try to watch

 that. Here. You're just in time for pre-dinner cosmos. In a crystal

 glass? Celia broke our last one six months ago. I've been drinking

 my cocktails out of a Scooby-Doo sippy cup. Mmm, I'm in heaven.

 So, it's movie night. Have you seen this? Does it have a

 talking penguin or a dog that plays basketball? No, just gratuitous sex

 and lots of violence. Yay, art. Oh-oh, somebody's glass is empty. That's

 also forbidden inside these walls. I know I don't know you guys

 that well, but I love you. Oh, wow. Are you okay? Oh,

 my God. All right, it's time for cake. - I got your

 favorite. - Chocolate? I got your second favorite. - Mom? - Yes?

 I have a date in half an hour. Can I go now?

 No, you cannot go. Preston's in Europe, Parker's at band practice, -

 you are representing all siblings. - Mom... Don't you feel bad we

 forgot her birthday? I didn't forget. I gave her a present this

 morning. So don't take it out on me that you and Dad

 failed as parents. We used up all our good parenting on you.

 That's why you're so delightful. Okay, here we go! - One, two,

 three... - Who's Polly? - Oh, my God! - Erase, erase, erase!

 Sweetie, I am so sorry. You know, I don't know if you

 know this, but pregnant women get a little scattered. And then your

 dad and I were talking about baby names, and I got on

 the phone with the bakery, and... Which is clearly a terrible excuse

 and again, I am so sorry. Let me fix this. Hey, that

 just made it worse, and how would you like a puppy? Forget

 it. But you haven't opened your presents yet. Come back. - Penny.

 - I know her name. - Nick! - Yeah. What What's going

 on? Danny took off. Listen to this. \"Didn't want to wake you.

 Went camping with Eddie. \"Had to clear my head about the whole

 Ana thing. \"P.S. Took my cell, but doubt we'll have reception.\" Good

 for him. Are you crazy? He's never been by himself. He knows

 how to drink out of a canteen and pee on a tree.

 - I think he'll be fine. - This isn't funny. Look, should

 he have asked us? Okay, yeah. But I think it's healthy. Hey,

 better hiking with Eddie than alone in his room with a bottle

 of pills. - I don't know. - He's 19. Eventually, we've got

 to let him live a normal life. He's never gonna have a

 normal life. None of us will. I realize the mistake was ours,

 Mr. Tan, but what am I supposed to do with 90 extra

 floral arrangements? Well, it will be your problem if I stop doing

 business with you. Yes. What can I do for you? Actually, the

 question is, what can I do for you? I'm sorry, did we

 have an appointment? No, but I've been wanting to meet you for

 such a long time, and when I woke up this morning, I

 told myself, \"Today is the day.\" - May I sit? - No,

 no, not just yet. - What is it you want, Mr... -

 Allen. Sam Allen. I have been following your career for a while

 now, Mrs. Hodge. I've been to some parties you've catered, I've got

 your cookbook. I've read every interview you've ever done. And I think

 you're quite amazing. How nice. Now, let's skip to the part where

 you assure me that you're not some deranged stalker. Hardly. I want

 to work for you. - Doing what? - Anything. Everything. I'm very

 busy, Mr. Allen. If you'd like, you could leave your r?sum? with

 my assistant... I worked as a sous-chef to put myself through business

 school, where I graduated at the top of my class. I know

 my way around a kitchen and a calculator. And I'm not asking

 you to pay me a lot of money. Not yet, anyway. I

 want to learn your business from the ground up. - And then

 I want to help you expand it. - Really? You are a

 woman who has something to say about traditional values. And I think

 our country is ready to listen. I am flattered. But I'm also

 fully staffed. And I honestly wouldn't know how to use you. I'm

 sorry. So am I. In regard to the extra floral arrangements, you

 could donate them to a hospital and record the loss as a

 charitable contribution. And if you split the arrangements in half, you could

 double the amount you claim. Just a thought. Mr. Allen... Now you

 can sit. Hey, where's your blushing bride? Upstairs in the can. What

 do you want? Well, I thought I would drop this off. It's

 a bouquet I found. Don't you think it'll be perfect for Karen?

 Haven't you done enough already? Huh? We had a good thing going,

 me and Karen. Now, 'cause of you, we're gonna get married and

 ruin it. Getting married isn't gonna ruin it. It's gonna make it

 better. - No, it isn't. It's like salt. - What? All my

 life, I never cared about salt. But when my doctor said I

 couldn't have it anymore, I started craving it. Wait. Are you telling

 me that you're gonna cheat on Karen? I go to a stretching

 class at the center. There's a lady with blue hair who always

 sits in front of me. Six months she's been there, I never

 gave a crap about her. But this morning, 48 hours after you

 told me I had to propose to Karen, I'm looking at old

 blue hair and I'm smacking my lips. Salt! You're 80 years old,

 Roy. Infidelity is dangerous. My body's 80, but inside, I'm still a

 randy teenage boy. Susan, I'm telling you, I have to kiss some

 other women before I die. Well, you can't, so forget it! Just

 think about Karen and how much she loves you. And if you

 do that, I'm sure you'll be able to resist any inappropriate urges.

 Okay? Yeah, that's the stuff. How is your wife being molested funny?

 It was just a kiss from an 80-year-old man. It's too bad

 he didn't grab my ass. You'd be rolling on the floor. What

 do you want me to do? Beat him up? Take the tennis

 balls off his walker? Okay, forget about me. What about what he's

 doing to Karen? I mean, they're about to get married and he

 has no intention of being faithful. Because he feels trapped. And whose

 fault is that? Don't point the mustard at me. Susan, I was

 there. You practically forced him into this. Okay, I made a mistake.

 I didn't know that he was some sort of Jurassic gigolo. I

 have to tell Karen about this right now. No. You've meddled enough.

 I can't let her marry him, knowing what I know. Susan, he's

 having second thoughts. I mean, come on. There's not a married man

 on Earth who didn't have second thoughts before he got married. Oh,

 really? I didn't mean... Okay, I'm done. See you, boys! Thanks for

 driving! Bye, Gabby! Don't forget to friend us! I won't, Fernando. And

 good luck with your pec implants. All right, time for a nightcap.

 Nightcaps. I'd forgotten all about nightcaps. I miss the gay, single life.

 You know what? She deserves the full experience. - We're gonna throw

 you a party. - Brilliant! I have mini-quiches in the freezer and

 10 homos on speed dial. It's done. I'm so excited! Invite those

 guys from tonight, except Fernando. - He's prettier than me. - Mmm.

 - Hi, it's Bob. - And Lee! - Leave a message. -

 Leave a message. Hey, guys. It's Carlos. I'm looking for Gabby. The

 doctor says the girls aren't contagious anymore, so she can come home

 now. Thanks. That's good news. What? That is horrible news. My children

 are healthy, damn it! - But you can go home now. -

 No. I'm not ready. I'm just starting to remember what it's like

 to be human again. Sleeping in, not stepping on toys, eating at

 restaurants that don't have a slide. I have tasted freedom and I

 am not ready to give it up! But what are you gonna

 tell Carlos? Oh, no. A stomach virus? Yeah. When you called earlier

 I was throwing up. Well, we don't want the girls to catch

 it. What's that noise? My teeth are chattering. Anyhow, I'll be home

 as soon as I can. The doctor says it's a 24-hour thing.

 - Don't forget the hangover. - Or a 36-hour thing. Got to

 go. Start pouring. I said I was throwing up. I don't want

 to be a liar. I can hire whomever I want. It's my

 company. And I run it for you. I should have been consulted.

 Why are you being so unpleasant about this? I hired Sam to

 help you. I don't need his help. I've got it under control.

 Andrew, all I've seen lately is evidence to the contrary. And if

 you think I'm gonna stand by while everything I've built falls apart...

 - Sam, I thought you'd gone home. - I stayed late to

 finish the inventory. Well, aren't you industrious? I also wanted to talk

 about Tad. What about him? Every task I've given him, he has

 either botched or failed to finish. I think it's time to cut

 our losses. We're not firing Tad. - Why not? He's a moron.

 - He's a good guy. And I don't want you talking that

 way about my employees. Andrew, you have to admit, he's more than

 a little incompetent. Give him a chance. He's just a kid. You're

 having an affair with him, aren't you? Sam, how could you say

 such a thing? I think the more pertinent question is, why isn't

 Andrew denying it? Andrew? Have you had sex with Tad? - Just

 once. - Oh, my God. He came on to me. It was

 late and I'd been drinking... That's your excuse? Honestly, Andrew. I am

 so disappointed in you. Really? You want to play that card? -

 You're living with Alex. - And you're married to Orson! Yeah, I

 know about Karl Mayer. \"Hello, Pot. I'm Kettle. It's nice to meet

 you.\" I cannot believe you would bring this up in front of

 a stranger. Yeah, you know me. Hypocrisy just makes me forget my

 manners. - Perhaps I should go. - Yes. But I want you

 back here bright and early tomorrow morning to help me fire Tad.

 No! No! You can't fire him! Yes, I can. In fact, I

 can fire anyone I want. And then right as I was taking

 off her bra, I woke up. What do you think that means?

 - Seems pretty straightforward. - But I'm not a lesbian. You're getting

 ahead of yourself. Maybe this dream isn't even about Robin. Maybe it's

 about how I've been so hurt by men that women are the

 only safe option left. Why are you even thinking about relationships at

 all, with men or women? You're still fragile. Now, when you're stronger,

 then we can talk about who you might be attracted to. But

 I'm not attracted to her. That's what I'm saying. Women my age

 don't just wake up one day with a whole new sexual identity.

 This dream has got to mean something else. Well, what it tells

 me, clearly, is that you are being distracted from your recovery. So

 what am I supposed to do? Stop dreaming? No. But you might

 want to consider asking Robin to find another place to stay. God,

 this lettering is so small, I can hardly read the label. All

 right, while you're deciding which one is dolphin-safe, I'm gonna get some

 beer. Hey, Mrs. Bolen! Do you shop here? Where's Danny? He said

 you guys were going camping. Oh, yeah, no... It turned out I

 couldn't go. So, he just went by himself. - You want to

 get in line? - You want to make me? Spill it. I'm

 sorry. He said he'd call you when he got there. Eddie. Hey,

 you guys back already? So where is he really? New York. Danny

 went to find Ana. Hey, hey. Don't freak out. It's a big

 city. What if he goes to the old neighborhood? - Patrick is

 not going to find him. - He found us the last time.

 Come on, I've got to go pack. You're in early. Oh, I

 couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd review our liability insurance. - But

 I'm having a little trouble focusing. - Maybe some coffee will perk

 you up. About what happened yesterday, Sam, that ugliness with Andrew... Driven,

 successful people like you have complicated lives. But the specifics are none

 of my business. My relationship with Andrew is, to say the least,

 complicated. I'm sure Andrew respects and loves you very much. - I

 just worry that... - What? Well... It's not unusual for children in

 a family business to have a sense of entitlement. I hope you

 don't mind me saying that. No. Go ahead. This must be so

 hard. What do you do in this situation? Keep coddling him, hoping

 he'll change? Or do you cut the apron strings and trust that

 all the hard work you've done will allow him to thrive? It's

 a good question. You know what? I've got everything under control here.

 Why don't you go back to the house and catch up on

 your sleep? But there's so much work to be done. Sure. But

 that's why you hired me, isn't it? To help you out? Thank

 you, Sam. You're very kind. And, Sam, I'm very glad you're here.

 - Come over to my house. - Okay. Come on, let's go.

 Hurry up. Wait, let's play. Let's go play kickball. Hey, Bert, I'm

 looking for Penny. She didn't get off the bus. That's because she

 didn't get on. I figured she went home sick or something. What?

 No, she didn't come home sick. Where is she? Penny! Mrs. Scavo?

 Penny said to give you this. She's running away. Any idea why

 she would run away? Problems at home? No, no, everything's fine. Well,

 we did kind of forget her birthday. And she put the wrong

 name on her birthday cake. Honey, could we please stick to the

 facts that pertain to the case? How could you get your daughter's

 name wrong? Are you people involved in narcotics? No! No, I'm pregnant,

 and it makes me very forgetful. Surely you can understand that. I'm

 not pregnant. You're not gonna look for our daughter, are you? Aguilar.

 Yeah, they're still here. Oh, okay. Your daughter's fine. She tried to

 use your credit card to check into a hotel. Hey. You mind

 if I come in? Wow. Marble bath, flat screen, $8 can of

 peanuts, nice. Sweetie, I am so sorry about the cake, and about

 forgetting your birthday. I know you hate me right now and I

 don't blame you. I don't hate you. I hate that. Oh. Because

 you're not gonna be the baby anymore. Penny, sweetie, you're missing the

 big picture here. Preston's gone. Porter's next. When this girl comes along,

 we are poised to take control of the house with a three-two

 majority. Do you know what that means? Women get veto power over

 what TV shows to watch, what take-out to get. Just think. Think

 of a world where the toilet seat is never up. This is

 our time to take them down. I'm sorry I ran away. -

 We can go home now. - I have a better idea. Since

 you've already paid for the room, how about we order hot fudge

 sundaes and spend the night? - Just us girls. - Yeah. Okay.

 You know, Mom, if you have two more girls, we'll take the

 lead. Let's just order our sundaes. So, there I was at this

 huge party, flirting with this Middle Eastern sheik, and out of nowhere,

 he offers me a million dollars to sleep with him. - So,

 what did you do? - I slapped him. Apparently in the right

 place, because I walked out of there with 20 grand. Gabby, it's

 Juanita. Excuse me, guys. Got to do the Mommie Dearest thing. Hi,

 sweetie. How was school? What? You scored a goal in soccer? What?

 Wait, hang on, sweetie, while I find a quiet place so Mommy

 can hear you. Hang on, sweetie. Okay, honey, Mommy can... Hold on,

 sweetie. Do the words \"wet paint\" mean nothing to you? Juanita, honey,

 I have to call you back. I love you. I'm sorry, I

 didn't mean to... - Is this a... - A nursery? Yes. We

 haven't told very many people yet, but Lee and I are trying

 to adopt a baby. Oh, I had no idea. Yeah, it's something

 we've wanted for years. Oh, okay. Why? I mean, you guys have

 this amazing life, parties every night, cosmos at 5:00. You know all

 that goes away when the baby comes. And we can't wait. Last

 month, there was this baby in Ohio. We got the call in

 the middle of the night, we were on a plane in the

 morning. We got to the hospital and there she was, a little

 girl. We held that baby in our arms for two days. And

 then we went out to buy a car seat to bring her

 home. And when we got back to the hospital, the social worker

 was waiting for us outside the nursery. The mother had changed her

 mind. I know how that feels. I am so sorry, Bob. You

 may envy our life, Gabby, but it's nothing compared to how we

 envy yours. Hey, what are you doing? The party's just getting started.

 I know. It's just... Juanita scored her first goal in soccer and

 she wants to tell me all about it, so... - Go. Give

 them a kiss for me. - I will. - Knock, knock. Karen,

 are you home? - I'm in here. Listen, I've been thinking about

 your wedding, and I just want to talk to you about... -

 What's wrong? - Nothing. The doctor found a spot on my lung.

 A spot? He thinks it might be cancer. - She told you,

 huh? - Yeah. It's gonna be okay. She's getting a biopsy next

 week. She's gonna lick this thing. Cancer picked a fight with the

 wrong broad. So given the diagnosis, maybe it's not a good time

 to get married. We are getting married as soon as we can.

 - But you said... - I know what I said. All I

 could think about was losing my independence, losing my freedom, but after

 this happened, now I realize the worst thing I could lose is

 her. So, you're willing to give up salt? I'm willing to give

 up anything. - Oh, Roy. - Uh, uh, uh. Watch it, doll.

 I told you I'm giving it up. One kiss is all you

 get. Hey, you're still up. Yeah. I sort of needed to talk

 to you about something. If it's me helping with the bills, I've

 got great news. You got the job? You're looking at the Downtown

 Grill's new hostess. I start tomorrow. Thank you for loaning me your

 top. The manager said I looked very classy. I can't tell you

 how happy this makes me. - So, you want to tell me

 your thing? - No. It can wait. - You sure? - Yeah.

 Absolutely. I'll get you a glass. Oh, my God! - Your blouse.

 I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Wait, what are you doing?

 - I'm just gonna rinse it out. - No, no, no! Stop.

 It's okay. - No, but it's gonna stain. - I'll send it

 to the dry cleaners. - But that's so expensive. Here we go.

 You have to leave. - What? - I need you to move

 out of my house. Why? It's complicated. Is this what you wanted

 to talk to me about? Yeah. I'm sorry if I did something

 wrong. I have a friend I can go stay with, so I'm

 just gonna go pack. Robin... You haven't done anything wrong. I like

 you very much. In fact, too much. Lately, I've started to have

 feelings for you that I don't understand. And it's confusing me. You

 know what I'm saying? I do. I'm having those feelings for you,

 too. You're right. I should go. Seduction is an art. Subtle methods

 of coercion are used to sway the susceptible and those who are

 determined will take their time to get what they want. And when

 the seduction is successful, those who succumbed ask themselves, \"Was I seduced?
