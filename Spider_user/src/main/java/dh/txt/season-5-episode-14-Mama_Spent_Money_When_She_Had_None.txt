 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. - Porter Scavo, you are under arrest. - What?

 Porter had nothing to do with that fire. Apparently, there's a witness

 that says otherwise. A witness? What're they talking about? Porter was accused,

 but not convicted. Katherine's love affair... I got the flowers. ...became serious.

 Mommy needs to lose a few pounds. You want to help Mommy

 be beautiful again? No. As did Gabby's resolve. Here's my cookbook. And

 Bree's success came at a price. You can be a little tough

 sometimes. - It's only to be expected. - I don't think I

 do that. I know you don't. People don't talk about money in

 the suburbs. Mostly because they don't need to. The ones who have

 it let you know with their brand-new clothes, their expensive appliances and

 their manicured lawns. The ones who don't have it let you know

 with barbecues that need replacing, walls that need painting and classic cars

 that need to be sold. Here you go, Walter. She's all yours.

 This is so awesome. Where's Tom? I want to thank him for

 making this the greatest day of my life. He's inside, but between

 sobs, he wished you happy driving. Where is that man going with

 Tom's car? That man is Walter Brotski, and he just bought it.

 Tom loves that car. Why would you sell it? Sadly, we can

 no longer afford Tom's midlife crisis. Okay, here's the deal. We're sort

 of broke. Oh, Lynette. Between Porter's legal fees and that ghost town

 that we call a restaurant... I thought Scavo's was doing well. When

 times get tough, people do without things like pizza and sports cars.

 I am so sorry. I had no idea. It's okay. Just keep

 it under your hat. It's a little embarrassing. You should not be

 embarrassed. This is a horrible economy. We're all in the same boat.

 Hello, ladies. What do you think? You bought a new car? My

 book just made the Times' bestseller list. Now they're talking three-book deal,

 so I got the urge to splurge. Oh! And look what just

 blew on my windshield at the stop sign. Life is good. Yes,

 people don't talk about money in the suburbs, because when they do,

 other people get angry. Whenever someone on Wisteria Lane buys a new

 car, a simple ritual is performed. So how do you like my

 new car? - It's gorgeous! - I am so jealous. I wish

 I had one. But on this day, one of the owner's friends

 refused to participate in the ritual. And even more surprisingly, the owner

 of the car in question didn't seem to notice. Look, there's even

 a refrigerator. The Lexus dealer said there's just enough room for a

 split of champagne and two chilled glasses. And the best thing is

 it's a hybrid, so you can barely hear it. Let me show

 you. Actually, I have to go to work. But congratulations, Bree, it's

 a beauty. Was it just me or was that a little abrupt?

 Don't take it personally. I think she's got other things on her

 mind. Oh, dear. Is something wrong? Well... Apparently, she and Tom are

 having financial problems. They just had to sell Tom's car. And, you

 know, I saw her at the recycling center. She was turning her

 cans in for money. Yikes. That's like a half a step away

 from selling your eggs on the Internet. And here I am, rubbing

 my fabulous new car in her face. I feel awful. Don't. How

 could you have known? Thank God I didn't show her how the

 car parks itself. But you're gonna show us, right? Well, it is

 pretty amazing. It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Mayer. Thank you

 for agreeing to see us, Mr. Hobson. Running a school like Oakridge

 mustn't leave you with much free time. Happy to oblige. So I

 heard through the grapevine that there might be an opening for another

 student? I assume you're referring to the Henderson boy's expulsion? Yeah. He

 bit his teacher, huh? They had that problem with their older boy,

 Toby. It's a family of biters. The whole situation was incredibly unfortunate,

 but we can't tolerate that kind of behavior. You wouldn't have to

 worry about that with MJ. He's so well-behaved. Look, I know how

 much you want your son at Oakridge. You've called us every week

 for the past five months. I've been too pushy. Please don't take

 it out on MJ. He is such a bright kid. - Say

 something in Spanish. - I'm bored. Be bored in Spanish. Mrs. Mayer,

 you can relax. We would love to have MJ join us here.

 - Seriously? - Yes. As a matter of fact, his name was

 first on our waiting list. Fantastic! Here's a schedule for you. Here

 are some insurance forms you need to fill out. And here's the

 tuition. As you can see, it's gone up a tad. Yeah. That's

 quite a tad. But we're starting in the middle of the year,

 so we'd only pay half, right? Yes. We've already prorated it. That

 is half. Fantastic. Hey, I just thought of a way for us

 to celebrate our anniversary next week. What do you think about dinner

 at The Palm? The Palm? As in, \"They don't even show the

 prices on the menu\" The Palm? Honey, we're still paying off credit

 card debt. Not anymore. The deal closed. I got the bonus. Oh,

 my God! That's great! Why didn't you tell me this when you

 were begging for sex this morning? You would've closed that deal, too.

 We're rich again! Hallelujah! We're not \"lighting cigars with five dollar bills\"

 rich, but we are headed in the right direction. Oh, honey, we're

 going to be us again, the old Carlos and Gabby. You know

 what? I'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed. You

 still fit in that? We're rich again! Hallelujah! Have you not noticed

 me working my butt off? I'm almost back to the weight I

 was when we got married. All I meant was you don't have

 to wear an old dress. I will buy you a new one.

 No, no. This'll be way more romantic. I'm one good colonic away

 from being the old me. I'll call the restaurant. They can write

 that on the cake. Sorry. I know how much you loved that

 car. This is all I have to remember her by. I called

 her Foxy. You want to know why? No. Tom. I just heard.

 You sold the car? Yeah. Well, we needed the money. The restaurant

 is dying. Apparently, people don't want to buy their pizza from parents

 of an alleged arsonist. Yeah, but Porter didn't do it. Maybe people

 still think that he's guilty or maybe it's the economy. Or maybe

 it's both. I don't know. All I know is, I am driving

 a \"dad car,\" while some other guy is out rolling with Foxy.

 Oh, buddy. I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could

 do. We should get going. But if we can help in any

 way, let us know, okay? Thanks. - Okay, what just happened back

 there? - Nothing. Yeah, like that's going to work. Why can't you

 ever remember who you're dealing with? Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob, I can

 keep this up all day. Bob? Fine. The day the case against

 Porter was dismissed, I was going over the discovery materials that the

 DA sent me. Okay? So? The witness who put Porter in the

 storage room at the club, the only one linking him directly to

 the arson, Tom's helpful buddy there, Dave Williams. - What? - Yeah.

 Porter wasn't even in the building. What the hell is Dave doing?

 I don't know, but we have to tell Tom and Lynette. -

 No, that'll just get ugly. - I'm okay with that. Lee, the

 charges have been dropped. It's no longer our business. Besides, there's something

 about that Dave guy that scares me. I don't get it. I'm

 only a few pounds away from my runway weight. You want me

 to let it out? That would be cheating. I'm going to try

 to go pee again. It's okay. You've had two children. The weight

 redistributes. Give in to it. I did. Jean, you didn't just give

 in to it. You slapped a piece of cheese on it. Yeah,

 I said it. Now just fix the hem. And this time, try

 not to leave the edges frayed. Hey, Edie! Wait up! Now don't

 forget, the clasp is broken. I'll replace it. It may not match

 exactly, but your hair will cover it. Jean, Carlos is taking me

 to The Palm, not out for hoagies. Make it perfect. - I

 see Jean is back. - Yeah. Times are good. Not for her.

 Hey, Ms. McCluskey said something about you losing five pounds in one

 day. How'd you do that? I got drunk on bourbon and threw

 up all over her lawn. No, not that story. Something about a

 boot camp. Oh, yeah. Just started. Very military, very intense. That's perfect.

 I'm trying to fit into an old dress. I need intense. Forget

 it. You can't get in without a recommendation, - and I'm not

 recommending you. - Why not? Because you'd embarrass me. This is real

 exercise. It's not the lotus position followed by a mocha latte. You're

 just afraid I'm going to look better than you. 6:00 a.m. The

 park. Prepare to die. Jeez. This is the tuition? We're going to

 blow his college fund on first grade. I know, I know. We

 may have to give up a few luxuries. Yeah, like food and

 heat. Okay, you know the problems they're having at his school. And

 now with all the budget cutbacks... I mean, this place is fabulous.

 I'm not saying it's not. I'd kill to send him there. I

 just can't swing it. We've got to do something. My editor just

 quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves. Could

 you pick up some extra shifts? Oh, yeah, I will. As soon

 as they create a 30-hour day. I'm working around the clock. What

 about that big job you just did for the last three months?

 What did you do with that money? Susan, we're not married anymore.

 What I do with my money, none of your business. Yeah, well,

 if we were still married, you... Probably would've waited until I finished

 my sentence. - What's this? - A check. I understand you and

 Tom are going through some rough times. No. Thank you, but I

 can't accept this. However, I would like to know how much I'm

 not accepting. $20,000? How many cookbooks are you selling, woman? We just

 went to a second printing, and now they're talking a three-book deal.

 So seriously, I'm not gonna miss that money. Wow, that must be

 nice. But I can't accept it. Why not? What's the point of

 success if you can't share it with the people you love? Because

 the people that you love may not be able to pay you

 back, and then you stop loving them. Then it's not a loan,

 it's a gift. - Don't you have a birthday coming up? -

 And so do you. And I'm going to feel real crappy when

 you unwrap your lavender bath beads. Come on, Lynette. You can't tell

 me this money won't take the pressure off. It would. But I

 can't. I wouldn't want it to affect our friendship. Okay. Although, how

 would you like to own a piece of an Italian restaurant? -

 What? - It wouldn't be a loan or a gift. It would

 be an investment that would buy you, say, 15% of Scavo's. That's

 an intriguing offer. If we do well, you get a cut of

 the profits. If we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the

 first $20,000. And then, of course, my family moves in with you.

 So, do we have a deal? We most certainly do, partner. Some

 people think it's strange I have a contract on my exercise class.

 But I want people to understand the commitment I expect from them.

 - I found in the past... - Here you go. All signed.

 - You didn't even read it. - No need. I'm up for

 anything. Although I did just get a manicure, so nothing that might

 chip a nail. Mrs. Solis, let me tell you what I learned

 in the Israeli army. A group without commitment is a group that

 will fail. The women in my morning class are committed. I am

 starting to think that you are not tough enough. Not tough enough?

 Let me tell you something, Mr. Iraqi army guy. - Israeli. -

 Whatever. I used to be a model and you don't know what

 war is until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch

 of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake. - I am

 plenty tough. - I'm not so sure. Hey, I know some of

 those women in your exercise class. The most exercise they ever get

 is cutting a piece of cake. That's a lap! - Excuse me?

 - In the contract. There are certain words I do not tolerate.

 \"Cake. Tired. Can't. Donut.\" If I hear them, you owe me a

 lap. It's an exercise class. Why would anyone say \"donut\"? That's another

 lap! You know, maybe I should give this a little gander. Come

 on, ladies! When I was in the special forces, we would do

 sit-ups in 115-degree weather. I still have sand in my ass. You

 people are weak! Let's go! Let's go! Gabby, knock it off. You're

 gonna get us all in trouble. It's hard. Of course it is.

 That's why it's called boot camp. Just hang in there, Gabby. We

 all went through it. Shut up, Mona. I'm puking air. He's coming.

 Get crunching. Hey, did I hear talking? Sorry, sir! She got a

 little nauseous. I don't give a rat's ass what your problem is.

 You retch on your own time. - Okay. We need to talk.

 - Gabby, no. What the hell are you doing? Get your butt

 back down! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Time-out. - Time-out? Look, I appreciate

 this whole military commando act. But I'm new at this, and frankly,

 this is a bit much. - A bit much? - Yeah. Are

 we going to get a break soon? We want a break. Like

 maybe some coffee, some pastry? That sounds so yummy. You got any?

 No, I don't got any! Now, get down or I'm going to

 put you down! I said time-out! There is no time-out! You signed

 a contract! Now get down! Don't take that tone with me. I

 am paying. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

 Do it! Do it! Who brought her here? That would be me!

 Sorry, sir! Because of Edie, our two-mile run is now four miles!

 - Oh, my God. Look at those! Wow! - Hey, what's going

 on? Susan, you got to check these out. Please don't make a

 fuss. They're magnificent! Susan, look at them. - What am I looking

 at exactly? - The pearls. - Oh, those. They're stunning. - Thank

 you. I have a big bar mitzvah to prep. See you. She's

 so lucky. Mike is such a great guy. What? Mike bought those?

 He bought her pearls? He's a keeper. That's right. You didn't keep

 him, did you? - Hi. - Lynette, hi. I wish I had

 time for a chat, but I'm on my way to a meeting.

 I might design my own line of bakeware. Can you imagine? -

 This will just take a sec. - Okay. Tom and I are

 so grateful for your investment that we want to do something special

 for you. That sounds lovely. We'd like to shut Scavo's down for

 the night and throw a party in your honor. Just family and

 friends. We'd toast your success and have a night of fun, just

 like old times. - What do you say? - That sounds nice.

 - Can we walk and talk? - Yeah, yeah. You know what

 might be even better? My publisher has been begging me to do

 a local launch for my book. I could do a signing at

 your restaurant and finally fill the place. Would you hold that for

 a moment? We've filled the place many times, but it's your party.

 Whatever you want. You can just put that on a hanger in

 the back. What I want is to make this an opportunity for

 you. We could turn one of your dismal Thursday night seatings into

 a real event. - I don't know what to say. - Don't

 thank me. It was your idea. Right. Glad I thought of it.

 Susan Mayer knew she couldn't always give her son everything she would've

 liked. But when she saw her child's tuition around Katherine Mayfair's neck,

 she felt something had been stolen from him. And it didn't take

 her long to decide how she was going to get it back.

 - Susan, hi. - Hi. You at home? Yeah. I'm just about

 to jump in the shower. What's up? I'm going crazy, 'cause I

 think I left my front door unlocked. Could you run and check?

 I'll stay on the line. No, no. I totally understand. The one

 day I don't lock up, I always think that's the day somebody's

 going to break in. Exactly. And so even though I was already

 halfway to the airport, I turned around and I came home, and,

 yep, I had left the garbage disposal on. So ever since then,

 I always check. I'm the same way. Anyway, you can relax. The

 front door's all locked up. You know what? I'm actually still worried

 about the side door. Do you think you could check that, too?

 Already did. You're good. I'm going to take that shower now. See

 you later, hon. Mike, is that you? You're just in time. -

 Susan? - Hi. Hey! Susan Mayer! For God's sake, give me back

 my pearls! - Pearls or towel, you decide. - You wouldn't dare.

 I have been naked on this street. It would be nice to

 take the heat off that story. Have you lost your mind? Mike

 said he can't afford to pay for MJ's private school. Now I

 know why. He wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls when she

 flashes him. What? He wouldn't pay for MJ's school? No. So I

 was going to take these and sell them to try to pay

 for it, and, yes, now that I'm saying it out loud, I

 hear how stupid that sounds. - I can't believe Mike would do

 that. - Well, he did. Hey, Mrs. Mayfair. It's nice to see

 you. Perhaps we should discuss this later. This can't be good. So

 is this a \"Welcome home, we missed you\" kind of thing or...

 Oh. Damn right, \"Oh.\" What happened to \"I'm broke, and can't afford

 to send MJ to private school?\" Don't get me wrong, Mike, it

 was a wonderfully generous present. But you can't go around blowing your

 kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend. What did these cost you?

 $4,000, $5,000? $ 129. - What? - They're fake, okay? And I

 knew how badly you wanted pearls, I couldn't afford real ones. And

 the salesman swore you'd never know the difference, and she didn't. Well...

 At least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them. I

 just wanted to get you a really nice gift and I don't

 know, I... I guess I was embarrassed when I couldn't. Mike, don't

 ever feel like you have to spend money to impress me. Okay?

 Trust me. I'm already very impressed. Okay, okay. Point made. Move along.

 I'll go fix us some dinner. - How dare you? - I

 didn't know they were fake. I mean, how dare you think that

 I would put jewelry for my girlfriend ahead of my son's education?

 Okay, maybe I jumped to conclusions, but this school is important for

 MJ. I feel really bad that we're falling short. Susan, I've been

 at work since 6:00 this morning and after I inhale a five-minute

 dinner, I'm going back out till midnight. I am busting my ass

 to give our son the best, so if we're falling short, it's

 not because of me. What? Where are you? You're late for training.

 Oh, yeah, I quit that. There is no quitting. It's in the

 contract. Yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer.

 Here he is. We're not leaving! Come on, ladies! Keep going! Keep

 it moving! What the hell do you think you're doing? When you

 don't come to boot camp, boot camp comes to you. Fall in!

 Are you out of your mind? I have two sleeping children. I

 know. I've seen the cellulite. Fall in! Do it, Gabby. There is

 no quitting. Don't get all holier than thou, Mona. I saw you

 pull into the Donut Shack yesterday. Donut! That's a lap. Oh, really?

 Try this on for size. I'm going back to bed, because I'm

 tired. And when I wake up, maybe I'll have some cake and

 you can't stop me. Gabby! Where are you going? If you don't

 get out there, he is gonna take it out on the rest

 of us. Frankly, some of them need it. I just came for

 a little remodel, and there are some real tear-downs out there. Wow.

 You are one spoiled, selfish little brat. For God's sakes, Edie, it's

 a stupid exercise class. I tried it. It sucked. I don't want

 to do it anymore. Lighten up. That stupid little exercise class is

 filled with women who bust their asses three times a week, while

 raising kids and holding down full-time jobs. They're crazy. He yells and

 they jump. He tells them to run all the way over here

 and they do it. He didn't make us come here. We agreed

 to. What the hell for? Because you told us that it was

 important to you to get into that dress. So we came here

 to support you. You wanted the old Gabby back? Well, congratulations. You

 got her. A self-centered, obnoxious jerk. Personally, I liked poor, paunchy Gabby

 better. At least she had some humility. Okay, time to stretch. Not

 you! You are 25 minutes late. Give me 50. Oh, my God.

 You're her! Well, technically, I'm she, but yes. Your turkey tetrazzini saved

 my marriage. - Would you sign this for me? - Certainly. I

 am so excited to be tasting your food tonight. My food? What

 are you talking about? Well, it says here the chefs of Scavo's

 are going to be making recipes from your book. They are? I

 can't wait to try that four-cheese pizza. You might have to. Excuse

 me. Lynette. I understand you and your fellow chefs will be serving

 my four-cheese pizza tonight. Yeah. Just adding the Parmesan. - But that's

 commercial Parmesan. - So? So that's like the dust they sweep off

 the floor of a place that makes real cheese. Oh, no. It's

 fine. We use it all the time. Perhaps you do, but my

 recipe specifies fresh-grated. Bree, no one will notice. Parmesan is the fourth

 cheese in a four-cheese pizza. It's the Ringo of these cheeses. Hey,

 Mr. Scavo said the grease trap is overflowing again. For Pete's sake.

 I'll be right back. Take your time. I'm sorry. We haven't been

 introduced. I'm Bree Hodge, part owner. - Hi, I'm Cindy. - We'll

 chat later. Roll out some dough and show me where the basil

 is. We'll be serving three-cheese pizza tonight. But what about the pizzas

 that we just made? Tom, I can't tell you how happy I

 am for you. This place is packed. It's packed! Yeah. You know

 what? Bree really came through for us. Wait, wait, wait. Even if

 she hadn't, you would've landed on your feet. I had total faith

 in you. And you have had three Scotch and sodas. Dude, this

 money goes right in your pocket. I'm just supporting you. Hey, I

 got to go check on that grease trap. I've got to get

 back to Edie. She wanted me home by 10:00. But, dude, congratulations.

 I'm proud of you. - See you. - You bet. - Hey,

 Tom? - Yeah? Nothing. Never mind. You're busy. You know, wait. I...

 I just want you to know that, that guy's not your friend.

 Who? Dave? - Is there someplace we can talk? - Yeah. Son

 of a... If this doesn't stop your mother-in-law from criticizing your cooking,

 I will give you a full refund. - Hey, can I borrow

 you a sec? - Now? People are waiting. You'll still be a

 celebrity in five minutes. Come on. Excuse me. You want to explain

 this? Oh, dear. I was hoping to spare your feelings, but since

 you know, I wasn't comfortable having my recipe made with substandard ingredients.

 We use that Parmesan all the time. You can't go changing things

 without asking me. Hey, you made me partner. I can change 15%

 and I chose the Parmesan. And I don't know if you've heard,

 but people are raving about my pizza. They probably would have loved

 my pizza, too, but we'll never know, because my partner threw it

 in the garbage. What a waste. Fine. I'll reimburse you, if that'll

 make things right. Oh, sure. It's only money, right? What's that supposed

 to mean? We all know how well you're doing, Bree. You have

 made that very clear. But you shouldn't be lording it over everybody

 just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks. Caught a couple of

 breaks? I've worked my ass off to get where I am. I've

 worked my ass off, too. I just wasn't as lucky as you.

 I've always believed that we create our own luck. Meaning that I've

 created my own failure? Not completely, but let's face it. You do

 cut corners. I mean, one of the things I can teach you

 is the importance of the attention to detail. Wow. Talk about luck!

 When I offered to throw you this little thank-you party, I never

 imagined that it would turn into an opportunity for me to learn

 from the great Bree Hodge. I'm not the one who needed $20,000

 to keep my business afloat. No, you're the one who's never gonna

 let me forget it. - Where are you going? - Home. Tell

 me how the party I threw for you turns out. Lynette, I

 don't understand why you're so upset. I know you don't, but five

 years ago you would've. My car! You know that was an accident,

 right? I did the best I could on the clasp, Mrs. Solis.

 I don't think you'll be able to tell the difference. Okay, be

 honest. Here I come. So what do you think? You are stunning.

 Radiant. Really? Really. You're back, Mrs. Solis, exactly like you were before.

 - I think I've changed a little bit. - Not that I

 can see. If there's nothing else, I'll be going. - Jean, wait.

 - What is it? Is there a problem? No, no. It's perfect.

 I just want to tell you how helpful you've been to me

 over the years, and I'm really grateful. Thank you. Hey, buddy. How

 was the rest of the... - I know what you did. -

 What? Don't give me that! I know that you told the cops

 that Porter set that fire. I didn't say he set the fire.

 I only said I saw him in the back hallway. You couldn't

 have! He wasn't there! Tom, the cops were really grilling me. They

 wouldn't let up. I had to tell them what I thought I

 saw. Porter could have gone to jail. You almost destroyed my family,

 destroyed our business... I'll make it up to you. I swear. I

 never meant to hurt you or Lynette. Lynette doesn't know about this.

 I didn't tell her. If I had, you'd be dead. I am

 so sorry. I never should have said anything to the cops. It

 was dark. I'd been drinking. You've got to believe me. Stop. Just

 stop. - Are you done? - Yeah. This is crazy. I mean,

 there's got to be some way we can work this out. We're

 friends. That's what I thought, too. But I don't know who you

 are. Tom. Tom. - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead.

 Shoot. I've been thinking a lot about your first wife. - Edie.

 - I know. Just one question, and then I'll shut it. I

 don't like talking about her. It has been weeks since I found

 out she even existed and I've never mentioned her once. Come on.

 Look at this as my reward. Okay. One question. Being married to

 her or being married to me, what's the biggest difference? Honestly? Our

 marriage is more real. - Really? In what way? - Hmm. Well,

 with her, it was like a fairy tale. I thought it would

 last forever. It didn't. What you and I have is more real,

 because I know it's not forever. When I hold you, when I

 kiss you, I try to remind myself to appreciate the moment, because

 tomorrow may never come. Love is just temporary. The way the fairy

 tale ends is death. My first instinct was to ask you if

 she was prettier than me. When will I learn to go with

 my gut? - I'm sorry. You can't afford the tuition? - No.

 But I read in your brochure that faculty members get a 50%

 discount. So for your art department, how would you like to hire

 an award-winning children's book illustrator, who is great with kids and has

 a face you can't say no to? Unfortunately, our art department is

 fully staffed. Can't say no. Mrs. Mayer, I appreciate your enthusiasm and

 the face, but I'm afraid it just won't work out. I wish

 you the best of luck. Yes. Right. No, wrong. Mrs. Mayer, please.

 I'm so busy. Look, I know I said that MJ was a

 star student, but the truth is, he's one of those kids that

 needs extra attention. The classes at his school are way too big,

 and I see him getting lost in the shuffle, and if he

 gets lost now... My ex-husband is doing everything that he can and

 I need to know that I am, too. I will serve lunches.

 I will be a janitor, anything. But I am not walking out

 on my son's future. One of our art teachers does need an

 assistant, but you're completely overqualified. I'll take it. Congratulations on your new

 job. Congratulations on getting me out of your office. - What's that?

 - A check for the damage to your car. I can't afford

 to go through my insurance company. Lynette, don't be silly. It's just

 the bumper. You don't need to do that. Yes, I do. And

 the minute we're back on our feet, I am going to pay

 back your investment. Every penny, with interest. Lynette, stop. Wait. Please. Don't

 be this way. I don't want money to get in the way
