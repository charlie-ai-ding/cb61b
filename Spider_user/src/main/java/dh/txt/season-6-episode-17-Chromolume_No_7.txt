 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. - May I sit? - Not just yet. What

 is it you want? I want to learn your business from the

 ground up. And then I want to help you expand it. -

 Bree... - Mr. Allen... ...hired a new employee. - Now you can

 sit. You should be saying, \"Great, Ana, go for it.\" Gabby thought

 she had ended a romance. - Where's Danny? - New York. Danny

 went to find Ana. - You have to leave. - Robin was

 asked to go, but Katherine had a change of heart. Preston Scavo

 was finally coming home from Europe, and his family was wondering what

 kind of souvenirs he'd be bringing them. His brother wanted an army

 knife from Switzerland. His sister wanted some wooden shoes from Holland. His

 father wanted some cheese from Bavaria. And his mother, well, all she

 wanted was to hold her little boy in her arms. Guess who's

 back! But she'd soon discover, her little boy wasn't so little anymore.

 - Hey! - Hey! Let me at him! I get the first

 hug! - Mom, you're huge! - I know! Well, look at you!

 Porter, now you don't have to grow a mustache to see how

 bad it would look. - What'd you bring me? - Penny, he

 just walked in. Give him a chance to unpack and give me

 my cheese. - Actually, I do have a little surprise. - There's

 plenty of time for that. You've been traveling all day. You probably

 want to take a shower - or a nap... - No, I

 kind of need to do this now. Yeah, Mom. You are really

 gonna want to see this surprise. Okay, I'm a little nervous. Maybe

 I should explain. No, you don't need to explain. I'm sure we're

 gonna love it. Everyone, I'd like you to meet Irina. Hello! I

 am finally to meet the lovely Preston family. Nice to meet you,

 Irina. Um... Preston didn't say he was bringing a friend. She's more

 than a friend, Mom. We're in love. Yes. Preston Scavo had returned

 from his trip with a beautiful souvenir, and his mother would soon

 wish he hadn't. Sometimes you must wash away the mud to reveal

 that sparkling yellow underneath. Sometimes you must carry the flower into the

 sunlight to appreciate the redness of the rose. Sometimes you have to

 take off the wrapping to understand just how green a bike can

 be. And if you want to see a woman's true colors, just

 make her feel unnecessary. - Ana, you're doing it again! - But

 you can't see my face! This is a tool calendar. It's gonna

 be hanging in some fat mechanic's basement, and he won't be looking

 at your face. I came to New York to be a fashion

 model! I came to make art films. Isn't life funny? I'm getting

 a donut. You have two minutes for an attitude adjustment. - Hey,

 Ana. - What are you doing here? - I've been looking everywhere

 for you. - You wasted your time. We broke up. We were

 broken up by your aunt. She doesn't care about your career. All

 she's ever cared about is keeping us apart. - That's why she

 sent you here. - Oh, my God! That's why the agency's only

 been sending me out on these crappy jobs. It all makes sense

 now. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Can we

 go somewhere and talk? Come on, January! Time is money. I quit.

 - Gabby You in here? - Yeah. I need Ana's address in

 New York. I'm on my way to the airport. - Why would

 you need that? - Because Danny ran off to find her. Well,

 I will save you the trip, 'cause if Danny finds Ana, she'll

 send him packing. She wants nothing to do with your son. She'll

 tell you herself. Hey, this is Ana, leave a message. And if

 you're my Aunt Gabby, I know what you did. Drop dead. Hold

 that cab. I'm coming with you. Hey. Wow, aren't you a little

 overdressed for bacon and eggs? And buttered toast. Buttered toast! Well, if

 I'd known that, I would have worn my formal boxers. So, do

 you like it? I got the check from the sale of the

 strip club and I decided to treat myself. Plus, I figured I

 needed something to wear when we go to Chez Naomi. Chez Naomi?

 Why don't we just stay home and eat money? Because you promised

 to take me there to celebrate paying your business loan off. I'm

 sorry, but that loan is years away from being paid off. Not

 anymore. I took care of it. - You did what? - With

 the check I got. What the hell did you do that for?

 Okay, what I think you meant to say was, \"Thanks, Susan. You're

 the best wife ever.\" That loan was my responsibility. You were paying

 9% interest. You were never gonna pay that loan off. Look, I

 appreciate it, but in the future, just check with me first, okay?

 Okay. I'm gonna take out the trash. - Now? - Lee's getting

 his mail. He can't see my new dress in here. Think about

 it. You already specialize in comfort food. Marry that with a Creole

 or Cajun twist. It's a no-brainer. - It's brilliant. I love it.

 - You love what? Sam just came up with the idea for

 my next cookbook, \"Down Home Cooking with Mrs. Van De Kamp.\" Thank

 you, Sam. \"My darling Sam, I couldn't make it through the day

 without you.\" What was that? It's the dedication page to your new

 cookbook, I'm guessing. Oh, and I have your first recipe. Apple Brown-Nose

 Betty. That's Sam's specialty. Since when is hard work brown-nosing? That young

 man is the first one here every morning and the last one

 to leave at night. Yeah, well, it takes a lot of time

 to turn all that water into wine. Well, I am sorry you

 don't appreciate him. I think he's tremendous. In fact, I have decided

 to give him a promotion. A promotion to what? Vice president. Hey!

 Check my stationery! I'm vice president. Well, a company can have more

 than one. There's plenty of work to go around. I don't believe

 this. You barely know the guy. - I'm your son. - I

 know you don't understand this now, but I am doing what I

 think is best for both of us. Remember that sentence. You'll be

 hearing it the day I put you in a nursing home. Oh!

 Did I wake you? Uh... No. I just didn't get much sleep

 last night. What's going on? Well, I was just on my way

 to buy some overpriced shoes to go with my overpriced dress. You

 want to come? Thanks, but it's not a good time. - Is

 everything okay? - Yeah, fine. Gotta go. Please don't shut me out,

 Katherine. Now that you're home from the hospital, I want us to

 go back to the way we used to be. There was a

 time you and I could tell each other anything. Hey, Susan. Morning,

 hon. I'll go make the coffee. So, anything you want to tell

 me? Yeah? - Are you Rose DeLuca? - Why? I think you're

 my grandma. Tyler? So, after we get to Manhattan, what's our plan?

 We go to Ana's modeling agency. I know that world. It's all

 interconnected. Someone will know someone who knows where they are. How do

 you know that world? Were you a model? Yeah. You didn't know?

 Big time. I was even on the cover of Vogue. - Really?

 What happened? - Mmm-hmm. I decided I wanted a different kind of

 life and married Carlos. Wow. Good for you. So? - What? -

 It's just, I shared something about my past, and I know nothing

 about yours, like where you grew up, or where you lived before

 moving to Fairview. - My past isn't that interesting. - Come on.

 I shared stuff about me. Telling me you were a supermodel is

 not sharing, it's bragging. It's not bragging when it's the truth. And

 the fact is, I was very successful. Well, if you were so

 successful, how come I've never heard of you before? Because you had

 to be looking in a fashion magazine, and I doubt you were

 ever doing that. - Are we done sharing? - Oh, yeah. Wow.

 So, Paris, Prague, Madrid. It sounds like you guys saw everything. But

 you still haven't told us how you two met. Well, the first

 time I saw Irina was on the beach in Nice. It was...

 How you say in English? The... - Topless? - Yes. Wow. You

 really did see everything. I was so embarrassed to show my breasts

 in public. - Well, clearly you've gotten over that. - Sweetie, would

 you give me a hand? - Oh, sure. Are you finished? -

 Thanks, Mom. Uh-huh. Why are you being so rude? Because I love

 that boy more than anything in the world, and there is no

 way in hell he could get a woman that hot. So, what

 does she want? Fine. He's dating out of his league. Remind me

 to high-five him later. Now, get back over there and be nice.

 - Here you go. - Thank you. You have given me so

 much beautiful food. You're welcome. And you have beautiful boots. Preston buy

 these for me in Paris. 300 euros. Almost 400 American, yes? Huh.

 I remember sending you money in Paris for an \"emergency.\" I didn't

 realize it involved footwear. Fine. I'll pay you back out of my

 college fund. Your son is so generous. You know, he promise to

 take me to the shopping spree in real American mall. I hear

 people pay $80 for t-shirt. Well, here in America, people are willing

 to pay a lot for beautiful things. I'm sorry, the water was

 running. Did you just say Katherine is a leprechaun? Lesbian. Katherine is

 a lesbian. Okay, the first one made more sense. Apparently, the other

 night, Katherine and Robin got a little drunk. Hold it. Robin? Yeah.

 She's a leprechaun, too. Wow, Katherine and Robin... Okay, okay, you can

 just get the image out of your head, - or I'm not

 gonna tell you anything else. - This is too weird. Well, a

 lot of people discover they're gay later in life. No. I mean,

 how could she go from being with me to being with women?

 Mike, she was probably leaning that way already. She was lucky to

 have you. You were a nice transition. - What? - Well, you

 know. I mean... When you make love, you're so gentle, and you

 like to cuddle... So, what are you saying, that I make love

 like a woman? No, no. I'm saying... That you are a well-balanced

 man who's in touch with his feminine side. I don't even have

 a feminine side. Mike, come on, I... It's what I love about

 you. - You cry at movies. - Movie! One movie! Brian's Song.

 And The Notebook. - Tears of boredom. - Mike. I don't want

 to talk about this anymore. Why is Daddy yelling? He may have

 turned a woman into a leprechaun. Look, you can complain about Irina

 all you like. I think she's nice. Please. Your opinion of her

 was set once you heard the word \"topless.\" That reminds me. Did

 Preston take any pictures on this trip? Tom, I was there when

 she unpacked her suitcase. \"Preston buy me this. Preston buy me that.\"

 I am telling you, that woman is, how do you say, a

 gold digger. You know, if you're right, she'll move on soon enough.

 Yeah. Yeah? I need to talk to you guys. I know that

 look. He's come to his senses. I proposed to Irina, and she

 said yes. Okay, I don't know that look at all. You proposed?

 But you've only known each other for a few months. Yeah, but

 she's the one. I know it. Oh, honey. Wake up! - What's

 that mean? - Your mother's just concerned that Irina might be with

 you for the wrong reasons. Like your college fund. Why'd you tell

 her about that? Wow. You must really think I'm an idiot. I

 think you're young, and I'm sorry, sometimes young is idiot-adjacent. You don't

 approve? Fine. I can live with that. - But I want Nana's

 ring. - No! You want to buy that woman boots, I can't

 stop you, but she is not getting my grandmother's ring. Nana promised

 I could have that ring when I got married. - You don't

 get a say. - Oh. Hey, you're making a mistake. Yeah, well,

 maybe the mistake I made was coming home. God, your friend owns

 this place? It's pretty swank. Yeah, we used to call it \"the

 house that bulimia built.\" I could have never been a model. I

 like food too much. Yeah. That's why. - Can somebody get me

 a coffee later? - Holy crap! Is that Heidi Klum? - Hey.

 - Yeah. - Do you want to meet her? - Get out!

 Sure. She's an old friend. Come on. Heidi! Hey! Heidi. Hi! It's

 me, Gabby. - Gabrielle Marquez. - I remember you. It's hard to

 forget someone who taped toilet paper to the bottom of my Manolo

 Blahniks, and laughed when I walked down the runway. I was quite

 the practical joker back then. Anyway, this is my friend Angie Bolen

 from Fairview. Practical joke, my ass. Because of you, I didn't get

 to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated. So screw you, screw

 your friend, and screw Fairview. She seems nice. - Gabrielle! - Luke!

 - Hello, gorgeous. - Hi! This is my neighbor, Angie. Oh! Nice

 cheek bones. Now, what the hell is up with that snotty niece

 of yours? I mean, don't get me wrong. She's gifted and she's

 got the look, - but that attitude! - Tell me about it.

 Do you have any idea where she is? She's not in her

 apartment. Your niece walked off a shoot. Her boyfriend, Broody McFine-Ass, showed

 up, told her that he had relatives in town they could stay

 with. Short story shorter, I don't know where she went, and don't

 care. - You have relatives in New York? - Only one. -

 Who's there? - It's me, Ma. What? I finally get to meet

 my grandson for the first time, and now you're telling me that

 he has to go? - You know it is not safe here,

 Ma. - Here's what I know. Every night for the past 18

 years, I was the only one at this table. Yeah. One plate,

 one cup, one chair. And then, someone knocks on my door, and

 they sit right there, and he calls me Grandma. I could have

 looked at him till my eyes dried up. And now you show

 up and you tell me it's not safe! - Why? The Feds

 don't care about him! - It's not the Feds I'm worried about.

 Oh. So that's why you want to take him away. Patrick Logan?

 If my kid shows up, he's a direct link to me. -

 That's how he'll find me. - That was 18 years ago. Patrick

 Logan does not care about you, and he sure as hell does

 not care about my grandson! Ma, please. I'll tell \"Danny\" you were

 here. Robin the stripper? You had sex with Robin the stripper? Holy

 Chaz Bono. - Was that the first time you ever... - Yes.

 And Robin's at her cousin's wedding, so I only have a couple

 of days to figure this out. Am I gay now? - Well,

 did you enjoy it? - I don't know. It was different. I

 mean, we started kissing and then we... No details necessary. Katherine, you're

 not gay. As much as you think you can switch your entree

 from meat to fish, it doesn't work that way. This is not

 a choice. But how could this have happened if I'm not gay?

 Look, I was with women all through my twenties... Any excuse to

 drag that out! But it always felt weird. Then when I slept

 with a man, - I knew that was it. - Then, 1,000

 men later, he found me. My point is, if it didn't feel

 quite right to you, chances are it was just a one-time thing.

 Maybe you're right. We were both pretty drunk. If you're not sure,

 take sex out of it. Get to know Robin. It's a little

 late to start dating. We already live together. That is fast. Maybe

 you are a lesbian. And in the short time he's been here,

 Sam has proved himself invaluable, so I would like you all to

 give your support to our new vice president. Thank you. This is

 a great company, but I think we can make it even better.

 Now, I've got a lot of great... I'm sorry. I was just

 showing my support. Carry on! Andrew! Is that a beer? Hey, just

 'cause you can't have a liquid lunch, doesn't mean the rest of

 us have to suffer. - Andrew! - It's okay. It's okay. I've

 got this. Okay, buddy, why don't we get you some coffee? Why

 don't we not? Besides, I believe everybody is waiting to hear how

 you're gonna sprinkle your magic fairy dust and whip this company into

 shape. Am I right? - You need to go now. - Get

 your hands off me! Andrew! Sam, are you okay? I'm fine. But

 if you don't mind, I think I'll take the rest of the

 day off. See? Told you he was a slacker. - Lynette, what

 can I do for you? - Hey, Jimmy. My son came home

 from Europe and is engaged to a beautiful Russian girl. - Congratulations.

 - I hate her. - Okay. - Anyway, this is my grandmother's

 ring, and Preston wants to give it to her. She's very lucky.

 - She's not getting this. - Okay. Because you are going to

 find me a cheap copy. I can try, but she's probably gonna

 know the difference. Oh, I'm counting on it. Irina is quite the

 opportunist. Five seconds after she gets it, she'll have that piece of

 glass appraised, and when she finds out my son has given her

 a fake, I'm betting that little Russian parasite will be looking for

 a new host body. But when your son finds out, isn't he

 going to be mad? That's why I keep having kids, Jimmy. To

 replace the ones who hate me. MJ's asleep. Are you coming to

 bed? I miss you. What, you need somebody to do your hair?

 You know us sensitive men are good at that. Please don't pout.

 You are all man. You're one of the strongest, most macho men

 I know. Now, come upstairs. I don't have to come upstairs to

 show you that. What are you doing? I can show you how

 macho I am right here. Don't you think our bed is a

 bit more comfortable? - Beds are for wimps. - Okay, that was

 MJ's lunch. And now I'm getting rid of this T-shirt. - God,

 what is this made of? - Here, let me take it off.

 - No! I'm ripping it. - Oh! Mike, you don't have anything

 to prove here. Where are the scissors? I just want to make

 a little starter cut. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm

 fine. I like it rough. I'm glad that you're having fun, but

 my back is hurting, - so let me get on top. -

 No! No! I'm on top. Seriously, Mike, I'm on a salt shaker.

 Sweetie? Are you okay? No, not really. Honestly, if I had known

 that you were going to get this upset about Katherine... It's not

 about Katherine. It's you. And it's not even really about you. It's

 me. Okay, just how hard did you hit your head? The loan,

 Susan. You paid off my loan. Well, isn't that a little 1956

 of you? I grew up watching a man who didn't provide for

 his family, and I always swore that was one thing I was

 gonna do. I'll never be rich, I'll never be famous, but I

 can be a guy who takes care of his family. In that

 case, I will cancel the check tomorrow, and you can pay the

 loan off by yourself. Thank you. Hey, you know that 1956 thing?

 Hmm? - It's kind of sexy. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. - Mmm.

 Ana, this is my 17th message. You might as well pick up

 the phone, because I am not leaving New York until I see

 you. Tell me, what exactly are you planning to do? Find Ana,

 cut the purse strings, destroy her hopes and dreams, then catch a

 Broadway show. Oh, my gosh! Hi, guys! Hi! Angie, you met Luke,

 and of course you recognize the beautiful Paulina Porizkova. She and I

 go way back. How have you been? Give me a hug! Why?

 What's wrong? You treated me like dirt, and now you want a

 hug? What are you talking about? You remember all the fun we

 had doing that photo shoot on the beach in Brazil? What I

 remember is getting you that job when you were just starting out,

 and then freezing on the sand for three hours while you bitched

 because they couldn't find the exact right shade of lipstick that would

 make you look pretty. I see you still haven't found it. You

 know, I really don't think I need to meet any more of

 your friends. I'm gonna go call Nick. Can you believe Paulina? What

 was that about? You're kidding, right? Okay, maybe I threw a little

 attitude once in a while. You didn't throw it, honey. You heaved

 it. Oh, come on. I was no worse than a lot of

 other girls. No, sweetie. You were the queen bitch diva. Insulting photographers,

 upsetting booking agents. That's why your career went down in flames. No,

 my career ended because I decided to marry Carlos. You remember. I

 called you the night he proposed. Yeah, and I told you to

 grab that brass ring, because I knew it was over for you.

 And you did, too. Or else you never would have left. Excuse

 me. I think I'm in the wrong place. - Does Sam Allen

 live here? - That one. But he's not here. Oh. Well, I

 guess I'll just leave these on his porch. If you want the

 dogs to eat it. Put it inside. It's unlocked. Mrs. Hodge? What

 are you doing with a picture of Rex? I'm waiting. He was

 my father. What? This is not how I wanted you to find

 out. I am so sorry. Bree! Let me explain! Irina really loved

 the ring, Mom. That's why she wanted to go right to a

 jeweler to get it sized. - Good. - Listen, I know I

 sprang this on you, but once you get to know her, you'll

 see what I see in her. I am looking forward to when

 we both see the same thing. Hello, everyone. - Hey, Irina! -

 Hey! You hungry? Mom made lentil soup. I told her it was

 your favorite. - Your mother is full of thoughts. - In English

 we say \"thoughtful.\" - Yes. - Hey, you're not wearing your ring.

 Gee, I hope there's not a problem. I am all day thinking

 about this ring. I do not want it. But Preston said you

 loved it. I do, but it is too precious. This ring has

 been in your family for generations, and for you to give it

 to woman you don't know, it feels wrong. Save it for Penny.

 Wow. What a classy thing to do. Thank you, Irina. You can

 buy me another ring. You sure? Nana's ring is worth a lot

 more than anything I can afford. Yes, Preston. I know exactly how

 much it is worth, but I want your mother to know I

 am full of thoughts, too. So, let's eat! Come on, Preston, get

 her a chair. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to tell me. Here

 you go, honey. Now, we're having a little salad... Wow. Two visits

 in 18 years. It's getting monotonous. I need to tell you something.

 About Patrick. This again? Fine. What about the great and powerful Patrick

 Logan? First you have to promise you won't ever tell Danny. Ana!

 There you are. - I have nothing to say to you. -

 Wait, wait, wait! Just give me five minutes. If you don't like

 what I have to say, - then you can tell me to

 go to hell. - Two minutes. I'll meet you inside. Before you

 start, I know you sent me to New York just to get

 me away from Danny. True. I begged Luke to take you, and

 he did me a favor. - I knew it! - But it

 turns out I was doing him a favor, too, because he thinks

 you're really talented. - He said that? - He also thinks you're

 a petulant, whiny, spoiled brat, just like I was, and that's gonna

 kill your career, just like it killed mine. - I thought you

 were successful. - I was. Until everyone was tired of putting up

 with my crap. So I want you to go back to Luke,

 apologize, and start acting like a professional. Modeling can be a great

 ride. I don't want you to be kicked off before it's over.

 Like I was. Mom, I know you're here for me, but I'm

 not going. All right, Grandma wants me to stay. No. I don't.

 - What did you say to her? - She didn't have to

 say anything. Your mother knows what's best. But we have a relationship

 now, hmm? We're gonna talk to each other all the time. -

 Really? - I promise. But as long as you're here, neither one

 of us is safe. Now, go pack your stuff. Hi. Do you

 by any chance know who that woman is talking to Rose? Yeah,

 that's her daughter, Angie. Really? I haven't seen her around here. Where's

 she visiting from? Fairview. Still out there. You really should talk to

 him. - I have nothing to say. - Bree, he's 26. He

 was born before you and Rex were married. Fidelity is not the

 issue. Rex had a secret life. Fine. Be mad at Rex, not

 at that young man. He's innocent. He showed up to work for

 me and didn't tell me that he was my dead husband's son.

 - What does he want? - There's only one way to find

 out. You told me you wanted to explain. You have two minutes.

 My mother and father met at a bar. He was single. So

 was she. They had one night together, and then he went away.

 When she found out she was pregnant, she called him. He had

 just met you, and said he was in love. He offered to

 support her financially, but my mom, who was very proud, turned him

 down. - But he did visit you. - A few times. But

 my mom asked him to stop because it was too hard on

 me. - And did you ever see him again? - Yes. From

 right here. I used to ride my bike over. I'd watch you

 and Andrew and Danielle. I wanted to understand why my father would

 choose all of you over me. And I did. You were all

 so perfect. My mom died six months ago. That's when I decided

 I needed to meet you. - Why didn't you tell me who

 you were? - Because I wanted you to like me. And I

 wasn't sure you would. You look cold. Why don't you come into

 the house, and I'll make you some hot chocolate and we can

 talk. Oh! Hey! Yeah, not to put any pressure on you, but

 I caught the bouquet. Oh. Do we need to talk? We haven't

 since it happened. First of all, you are a wonderful, beautiful person.

 Oh. Yowza. I was drunk. I didn't even know what I was

 doing until I was doing it, and then, well... The other night

 was a mistake. And I'm so sorry. That is complete crap. What?

 I'm not gonna let you blame what happened on being drunk. Okay,

 then. You know what I've been through recently, and maybe I was

 trying to forget that with you, but I am not attracted to

 women, so, no matter what it was, it doesn't count. I know

 how you touched me, and I... I saw the look in your

 eyes when I touched you. You may deny it now, but we

 connected. And it counted. Okay. It counted. Thank you. Hey. You want

 an extra pillow? There's empty seats in the back. I'm just gonna

 go sleep there. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm just tired. Well,

 you may have picked up on this trip that I haven't always

 been a good person. I'm gonna work on that, starting with you.

 Did Danny say there were seats in the back? No, no, no.

 Come on, come on. I'm serious. I'm serious. Look. I know you

 have a secret. Carlos and I overheard you and Nick fighting. Something

 about \"blowing your cover\"? Don't worry, I didn't tell anybody. I just...

 I just want you to know that I've carried around a lot

 of secrets, and I know how lonely it can feel. So, if

 you ever need a friend... Okay. When I was 18, I wanted

 to save the planet. I organized protests against logging companies, big oil,

 auto plants... But then I got involved with a bad guy. A

 really bad guy. He convinced me that we had to get more

 aggressive. Long story short, someone got killed. So, this bad guy... You're

 not talking about Nick, are you? No, he's the one who helped

 me run away from the psycho. So, who's the psycho? Danny's father.

 It's not always easy to see someone's true colors. Sometimes, you must

 look beneath the masculine veneer to find that fragile ego. You must

 ignore the sparkle of the jewel to know you're looking at a

 fake. You must bring the truth out of the shadows to see

 the beauty of its smile. Yes, people hide their true nature from

 us every day, and sadly, we only find out when it's too

 late. Mr. Logan? It's Iris Beckley. I live next to Rose DeLuca.

 You told me to give you a ring if I ever saw

 Rose's daughter. No. No, no, no. I'll tell you where she lives
