 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: The Scavos prepared for a grand opening.

 This could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family.

 While Gabrielle had a few too many drinks. I'm gonna take a

 little nap, OK? And a cry for help made Orson lose his

 cool. Suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family!

 - Mike got arrested. - Oh, thank God. And a friendship hit

 the rocks. - For the sake of our friendship... - Our friendship

 is over. Orson's mom was determined... In the eyes of God, you're

 the other woman. ... to bring Alma and Orson back together. [Bree]

 She raped you, and your mother helped. I think it's time I

 told you about the night Monique died. Alma became a prisoner. Gloria?

 - Bree was set up to take a fall. - Mom? And

 Mike was finally able to remember the past. [Mary Alice] Orson Hodge

 had always assumed that the moment before he died, his entire life

 would flash before his eyes. But as he fell from the roof

 of the Fairview Memorial Hospital, it wasn't his life he saw. It

 was one night in particular. Monique. I have wonderful news. Bonnes nouvelles.

 Monique. There's been an accident. Oh, my God. - What have you

 done? - It was self-defense. I came to tell her to stay

 away from you. She attacked me. Mother... she's dead. I know. And

 I'm sorry. But what's done is done. - What are you doing?

 - Calling the police. - I'll go to jail. - You killed

 someone. I'm your mother. You've got to help me. But I loved

 her. I once lost someone I loved, thanks to you. You owe

 me. - [knock on door] - [Mike] Hello? Ms. Polier? I've got

 that part for the sink. Hello? Ms. Polier? I'm sorry. I'm Monique's

 boyfriend. She's upstairs lying down. She wasn't feeling well. I'll finish up

 the sink and get out of your hair. Why don't you let

 me take care of that? I'm pretty handy, and it's getting late.

 - I don't mind staying. - No, I've got it under control.

 Here, let me, uh... Let me pay you. That should cover it.

 Thanks. Oh, hey, don't forget your wrench. You handled that very well,

 son. Now help me find a tarp. [Orson grunts] [GIoria grunts] What

 are you doing? You don't want her identified through dental records, do

 you? I must say, I never realized your job was so difficult.

 It's not enough to kill her? You have to desecrate her body

 too? Get away from her! [GIoria panting] [grunting] Now look what you've

 done. I think my damn hip's broken. Help me. [Mary Alice] Yes,

 Orson Hodge had always assumed that his life would flash before his

 eyes the moment before he died. - Luckily for Orson... - [man]

 Come on! ... that moment... - I got a pulse. Let's get

 him inside. - Get a backboard and a collar. ... was not

 scheduled for today. [Mary Alice] The first light of sunrise. - [meowing]

 - The sound of a cat purring. [purring] The smell of fresh

 coffee. Yes, there are many things a housewife likes to wake up

 to. But an unexpected guest in her bed is not one of

 them. Zach? You're in your underwear. Well, I needed to put on

 something to get the morning paper. You've been here all night? Sure.

 I'm not one of those guys who gets up and leaves right

 after. - Right after what? - Do you wanna hear me say

 it? Fine. You were amazing. OK, listen to me very carefully. And

 this is no time to be vague. What exactly was I amazing

 at? Please tell me that once contained a mint. After a few

 drinks, you told me how lonely you were, and that I was

 the kindest man you'd met in a few years, and... ...then you

 kissed me. And then you took off your... OK, OK, stop talking.

 I'm getting nauseous. This is so great. I have so many awesome

 plans for us. Us. Oh, man, it feels so good to say

 that. - Oh, God, here it comes. - Would you like me

 to hold your hair? No! Hey. What are you doing? I'm lying

 in bed, thinking about the opening tonight, when it hits me. -

 We could run out of bread sticks. - Oh, honey. You have

 had, what, four hours sleep in the past three days? You need

 rest. Who cares if we run out of bread sticks? I do.

 Tonight's the most important night of my life. Everything's gotta be perfect.

 Here. Try that. - It's good. - No. Too salty. If they're

 salty, we'll sell more beer. See? You're a genius. Don't patronize me.

 Oh, my God. This is gonna be a disaster. Hey, chill out.

 You're acting like I did when I was six months pregnant. Excuse

 me. You were hitting people. Only two. And the mailman had the

 good taste never to bring that up again. - Let's go sleep.

 - The doughmaker has to be fixed. - The chairs get delivered

 at noon. - I know. I put in the order. I will

 handle anything that needs to be done. And you take these and

 get some sleep. We need you at your best tonight. You're right.

 I'm sorry. I'm crazy. [chuckles] Honey glaze. Honey glaze will cut the

 salt in the bread sticks. Tom, I do not need to be

 pregnant to kick your ass. Now go. Go on. Andrew, you're here.

 - What happened to me? - You kind of had an accident.

 - You fell off our ladder. - Oh, that's right. Is Orson

 here? He's at the hospital, but he's not exactly visiting. Suicide? No.

 Orson would never try to kill himself. It must have been an

 accident. They found his footprints on the trunk of his car. The

 only reason he'd be up there is to jump. - But why?

 - Maybe he was feeling guilty. For what? Mom, I looked at

 that ladder. Someone sawed through the rung. - And you think... -

 I heard you two the other day. You told him to turn

 himself in or else. The next day you fall and nearly die.

 You think that's a coincidence? - You say he's just down the

 hall? - Yeah, but don't worry. I told them not to let

 him near you. And we're gonna get you home as soon as

 we can. Can I help you? I'm here to pick up my

 wife's belongings. Jane Hainsworth. Oh. Yes. I'm so sorry for your loss.

 I'll be right back. - You doing OK? - Not really. But

 having you here helps. - Oh. Hey, Mrs. Mayer. - What are

 you doing at the hospital? You haven't heard? Hey. Susan. I just

 heard from Andrew what happened. I had to come see you. -

 If you want me to go, I... - No, no. Come in.

 I know we've been fighting, but something like this happens, it puts

 everything into perspective. I am so sorry. If I hadn't got so

 caught up in protecting Mike... Susan, stop. Mike is innocent. He had

 nothing to do with Monique Polier's murder. - Do you know something?

 - Yes. And I intend to go to the police. Oh, my

 God. Does this have something to do with Orson's accident? I can't

 tell you right now. You're just gonna have to trust me. Can

 you do that? [sighs] Of course. I should let you rest. So

 we're back to being friends? We never really stopped. Um, excuse me.

 These things don't belong to Jane. Are you sure? Every couple has

 their secrets, but I'm sure she wasn't a closet whittler. - Mike

 Delfino. - These are Mike's things? Yep. Someone made a big mistake.

 Helen, you screwed up the labels again. Oh! He had an engagement

 ring with him. That's pretty. You know, Mike and I are good

 friends. I could return these things to him, if you like. Sorry.

 He'll have to pick them up himself. It's hospital policy. It's also

 hospital policy to put the right labels on the right boxes. Ian,

 you're not gonna believe this. Bree told me she can prove Mike's

 innocent. - What? - It's true. He's gonna be a free man.

 - Isn't that great? - Yes, it's bloody fantastic. [sighs] Oops! Here.

 I'm gonna go get Bree some flowers. I'll be right back. No,

 no, that's great news. Thank you, doctor. So, uh, Orson's gonna pull

 through? You'd rather he didn't? No. I just don't know what he's

 gonna tell the police when he wakes up. Wasn't your fault. Orson

 falling off that roof was an accident, right? - Well, sort of.

 - Sort of? Depending on what Orson tells them, I could get

 charged with attempted murder. [Lynette] I'm so glad she has you to

 take care of her, and, of course, your mom comes first, Andrew.

 And I wouldn't even ask except we're opening tonight... - Chairs are

 here. - Uh... Uh-huh. Oh, God, seriously? Fantastic, thank you. Two quick

 hours and we'll get you right back home with your mom. Thank

 you, Andrew. OK, bye-bye. Did you finish folding the takeout menus? You

 never asked me to do that. I shouldn't have to tell you

 every little thing. Show some initiative. Wait. Where are my chairs? I

 didn't order these. - You Lynette Scavo? - Yes. Well then, you

 ordered these. Why would I order 50 highchairs for the opening of

 a pizzeria? I thought it was one of those kiddy pizza places,

 with the games and the animatronic rats. - Easy there. - Animatronic

 rats. Where do they find you people? OK, OK. Here it is.

 See? I ordered 50 of item number seven three... Oh. Huh. -

 Did we find the mistake? - I, um, switched the seven and

 the one. - Mmm-hmm. - So we're both wrong. Now, this place

 opens in five hours. How long will it take to fix this?

 Hi. I need to rent 50 chairs by tonight at five. What?

 Why not? What do you mean, it's bar mitzvah season? There's no

 such thing. You still have five? I will take those. Scavo. OK.

 That brings us to 22. Javi, Rico, we got chairs to find.

 Move it. Wow. Looks like someone crawled into a bottle of merlot

 last night. Sort of threw myself a little birthday party. So, if

 you don't mind, I'd like to get back to my dry heaving.

 Quick question. Was that Zach Young I saw leaving your house at

 eight this morning? Oh. Yeah. Um, he just came by to, uh,

 drop off a birthday card. Really cute, little cat with balloons. -

 All right, bye. - Follow-up. Why was Zach in your driveway at

 seven this morning, in his underwear? - We had sex last night.

 - What? I mean, I think we did. That's what he told

 me. - Weren't you there? - I don't remember anything. I just

 woke up and he was in bed next to me. Thanks again,

 Gabby. Hey, Carlos. If you don't remember, then how can you be

 sure that you and Zach had sex? Well, we were both half-naked,

 and there was a condom wrapper, and he said I was amazing,

 which totally sounds like me. He thinks we're a couple now. You

 have to help me. [laughs] I am not getting involved. God, I

 can't believe you bagged another neighborhood kid. - Where are you going?

 - To warn the Scavo boys. [moans] - I wanna speak to

 my wife. - She's resting. If we can get back to these

 questions... I fell off a roof. I need a physician, not a

 psychiatrist. It's hospital policy when there's a suspected suicide attempt. - I

 didn't try to kill myself. - But you do have a certain

 history. You spent most of 1976 in a psychiatric hospital. I don't

 care to discuss that. You won't be leaving here until we do.

 My parents were very religious. When I was 16, my father had

 an affair. Caused quite a scandal at our church. He became depressed.

 He started drinking heavily. My mother grew concerned. She didn't like leaving

 him alone. One night she had to visit a sick friend and

 asked me to keep an eye on him, but I'd made plans

 with friends. I thought I could duck out for a while. When

 I got home, I found him in the bathroom. You blamed yourself?

 I didn't need to. Mother blamed me enough for both of us.

 That must've caused quite a strain in your relationship. Yes. But now

 and then she suggests little ways I might make it up to

 her. Yes, I'm calling to check on the status of a patient.

 Last name Hodge. What do you mean, which Hodge? Gloria, thank God.

 I thought you'd forgotten about me. - When are you letting me

 out of here? - It won't be long now. In fact, something

 interesting happened last night. Orson tried to kill himself. - Oh, my

 goodness. Is he OK? - He'll be fine. My point is, suicide

 is hardly the act of a happily married man. Gloria, for God's

 sake, give it up. - He doesn't love me. - He will,

 dear. Bree will be gone soon, and he'll need a good woman

 like you to console him. What are you gonna do to Bree?

 Gloria? Gloria! - Oh, hey, hon. Did you get some sleep? -

 Hey. Yes. I'm still kinda groggy from those pills, but... - And

 now I'm awake. - OK, little mix-up with the new chairs. -

 Which you were in charge of. - OK, OK, we could point

 fingers. But what's important is forgetting what we expected, and focusing on

 what we have, which isn't so bad. I mean, all the different

 kinds of chairs give the place a kind of bohemian vibe. Plus,

 if we get a lot of babies, look, we're just totally set.

 Tom, I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry. I just... I realize it's

 not perfect. But... Please say something. What can I say, Lynette? It

 is what it is. Why do I have to baby-sit Mom? All

 my friends are gonna be at the opening. - Austin was gonna

 sneak us beer. - Damn it, I have to work. Our mother's

 lying helpless upstairs. Her husband tried to kill her. For just one

 night, could you try to be responsible? [Danielle] I liked you better

 when you were a psychopath! [indistinct chatter] Here you go. - Oh.

 You're here. - I wouldn't have missed it. You know how I

 feel about Lynette and Tom. Uh, look. Zach, I'm glad you're here.

 I've been wanting to talk, about us. Me too. You being in

 my life now, having the connection that we do, this is really

 the first time I've been happy since my mother killed herself. -

 Could you excuse me a second? - Of course, baby. Hurry back.

 I am in hell. I just tried to break up with Zach.

 The little twerp played the dead mommy card. - Can't let him

 make you feel guilty. - But I am guilty. I don't remember

 how we ended up in bed together. Maybe I led him on.

 I've got to be sensitive here. - Could you threaten him for

 me? - What? Intimidate him. Do the whole jealous, Latin, ex-husband thing

 you do. If you can't have me, nobody can. Forget it. I'm

 not gonna do that to poor Zach. Hey, I am looking out

 for Zach, too. If I dump him, it'll destroy him emotionally. Better

 to scare him off. Please? - Fine. - Thank you. OK, look,

 there he goes. Go. Go get all cholo on his ass. -

 Hey, Mr. Solis. - Hey. [Carlos sighs] Look, I need to talk

 to you about something. It's a little awkward, but... - Mr. Solis?

 - What? You were just saying that something was awkward? Never mind.

 Forget that I said anything. - Hey. So how'd it go? -

 You did not have sex with Zach Young. Really? Did he tell

 you that? - He didn't have to. - What? I was standing

 next to him at the urinal. I don't care how drunk you

 were, if you had sex with him, you'd remember. Little Zach Young?

 Well, just how much would I have remembered? [doorbell rings] - Uh,

 hey. What are you doing here? - I thought Bree might like

 some soup. It's my own special recipe. I was surprised to find

 you home. I thought the whole street was going to Scavo's tonight.

 Well, I was supposed to go. But, uh, Andrew said I had

 to stay home and baby-sit Mom. Well, that's just silly. A vibrant

 young lady like you should be at the party, turning boys' heads.

 You go. I'll look after your mother. - You mean it? -

 Just take her dinner up first. I don't think I can manage

 the tray with my cane. Thanks, Grandma. You're the best. This soup

 smells so good. You wanna score some points, don't say I brought

 it. Tell her you made it yourself. Hey! Hey! Hello! Over here!

 [AIma screams] Honey, there is a line out the door. We are

 gonna make a killing tonight. I'm happy for you. - For us.

 - Now it's us? I thought I was the one who was

 trying to ruin everything. OK, look, I know I overreacted... Yes, you

 did, but... I have customers. - Place came out great, huh? -

 Sure did. Looks like the whole street's here. Yeah. Except for Orson,

 who fell off a roof. You know anything about that? Why would

 you think that? I heard you talking to Carlos. Answer the question.

 I... I can't talk about it here. - It's complicated. - It

 always is with you. Hey, I just had a slice of pizza.

 It's pretty good. Is it really good, or are you just pretending

 you had a slice? - You and I did not have sex.

 Admit it. - Of course we did. Zach, how can you claim

 to care about me and lie to my face? I'm sorry. I'm

 tired of just being your friend. I thought if you saw me

 as a lover, you could think of me as a man, not

 a boy. Zach, a real man is honest. All you've tried to

 do is bribe and trick me into falling in love with you.

 A little advice next time? Don't play games. Just stand up and

 be the kind of man a woman would be proud to share

 her life with. [clinking glass] Hello! - It's high time to make

 a toast. - [man] Sure. Um, Tom, where are you? Where...? Tom,

 you did it. There are a lot of people in this room

 that didn't think you could pull it off. - OK, well, maybe

 just me. - [laughter] Anyway, congratulations. The pizza is excellent, and the

 service is sublime. - Cheers. - [Carlos] Speech! [applause] Thank you. Thank

 you for coming. It means everything in the world to me. When

 I arrived here this afternoon and I saw these weird chairs, um,

 I thought the evening was gonna be a total disaster. But now,

 when I look out, I can't even see the chairs. I just

 see people eating, laughing, and having a great time. It's absolutely perfect.

 And none of this would have happened without my amazing partner Lynette.

 [cheering] Who, uh... to... I'm sorry. I'm a little... [Lynette laughs] I

 think what my husband is trying to say is, if you wanna

 test a marriage, open a restaurant together. Anyway, um, thank you for

 coming. Eat a lot and come back. - 'Cause our kids need

 braces. - [cheering] Actually, as long as everyone has their glasses raised,

 I have something that I would like to say. I... Well, I

 thought of waiting for the perfect romantic spot to ask this question,

 but being here tonight, enveloped by so much love and warmth, I

 realize that, um, this is the perfect romantic spot. - Susan Mayer...

 - Drop the pizza. Will you make me the happiest man in

 the world and be my wife? Absolutely. Yes. [cheering] Ladies and gentlemen,

 please. I have something that I'd like to say also. Gabrielle Solis,

 will you marry me? [indistinct gasping] No, there will be no clapping.

 You. Moron. Come with me. Time for your pills, Mr. Hodge. It's

 after six? I need to speak with my wife. - What room

 is she in? - Oh. Your wife checked out. - Already? -

 She was very eager to get home. - Don't worry. She'll be

 fine. - I have to talk to her. Oh. That reminds me,

 your mother called. She said she didn't wanna wake you up. She

 wanted to make sure we'd be keeping you overnight. Moms are like

 that, so protective. - [grunts] - [answering machine beeps] [Orson] Bree, it's

 me. Are you there? Please pick up. Bree? Please, somebody, pick up

 the phone. - [Zach] You're mad... - [Gabby] I'm done. - You

 said to be honest. - I did not say to humiliate me.

 I'm sorry. All right, I was just trying to... - What do

 you want from me? - I want you to leave me alone.

 This friends thing isn't gonna work. You'll always want more. - And

 I'm never gonna love you. Ever. - Ha. Ha. Twenty years from

 now, when you're all middle-aged and alone, - you'll regret this. -

 OK. I'll take my chances. - Thought you might need this. -

 Bless you. So how did it go with Seabiscuit? - He's devastated.

 - Of course. It's my fault. I should have known he couldn't

 handle the whole \"let's be friends\" thing. I don't blame him. I'm

 having kind of a hard time myself being just your friend. Watching

 you with other guys, being your confidant. Really? I think it's been

 nice. For you maybe. Seriously, I don't know how much longer I'm

 gonna be able to keep this up. Wow. Well, hang in there

 as long as you can because I still need you. I'll do

 my best. [indistinct chatter] What are you doing here? I have better

 things to do than baby-sit Mom. She's fine. Gloria's watching her. What?

 I told you Mom's ready to go to the cops about Orson.

 How could you leave her at home with his crazy mother? She

 brought soup. Gloria. What are you doing here? I came to take

 care of you. I'm so sleepy. Good. Then the pills are working.

 Andrew! Danielle! They're gone. It's just us. Now, you rest, hon. I'm

 gonna draw you a nice, warm bath. [moans] [water running in tub]

 [striking match] Oh, Bree. I wish I could make you understand how

 deeply I regret having to do this. Monique, that was easy. She

 was a slut. You're a good woman. You didn't know Orson already

 had a wife. But he did. And he made a vow to

 her before God. What sort of mother would I be if I

 let him break it? I'm sorry. But I will not let him

 be his father's son. [sighs] Wake up, Mr. Hodge. I've got dinner.

 That water's not too hot, is it? No, it's just right. [tires

 screeching] Mom? You all right? [Orson groaning] Andrew. You've done this before,

 haven't you? [GIoria] Ow! Oh! Oof! Uh! - Is she all right?

 - She will be. Get her some blankets and some dry clothes.

 [GIoria] Orson? Orson! Something's wrong. I think I'm having a stroke. You

 need an ambulance, Mother. It's too bad there's no one here who'd

 dream of calling you one. [wheezing] - What are you doing? -

 I don't want her dying in our house. Hey there. Are you

 all right? Your mother, she tried to kill me. Don't worry about

 her. She's never gonna hurt you again. - And neither will Alma.

 - Alma? - She's dead. - What? I don't know what happened,

 but she's gone. And she's taking our troubles with her. Tomorrow morning

 one of our neighbors will stumble on a gruesome surprise, two bodies

 side by side. The police will conclude that Alma fell from the

 roof, and when my mother found her, she suffered a stroke. When

 they search the house, they'll find the note Alma wrote when she

 faked her suicide, and next to it a bag containing Monique's teeth.

 In the face of such evidence, they'll have no choice but to

 drop the charges against Mike Delfino. And then you and I are

 gonna take that honeymoon we never got around to. I'd love that.

 What about your mother? I mean, after all the things she's done,

 is she just gonna get off scot-free? Thank you, doctor. I know

 you did all you could. Good news, Mother. The doctor said your

 stroke has left you completely paralyzed. You can't even speak. Which means

 all our secrets will be safe forever. Oh, here's the best part.

 Your brain is functioning normally. So I don't have to worry about

 putting you in jail. You're already there. Now, I'm gonna turn your

 head, so you can watch me walk away. You don't wanna miss

 it, 'cause it's the last time you'll ever see me. [Mary Alice]

 A surprising thing happened to Orson Hodge as he left Fairview Memorial

 hospital. His life began to flash before his eyes. But it wasn't

 his past he saw. It was his future. Ordinary suburban days filled

 with ordinary suburban moments, each made beautiful because of the housewife by

 his side. Yes, Orson could finally envision a life free from secrets

 and pain. And he couldn't wait for it to begin. Honey, I'm
