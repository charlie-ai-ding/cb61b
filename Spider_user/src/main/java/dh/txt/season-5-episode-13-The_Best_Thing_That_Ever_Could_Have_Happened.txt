 ":"Eli

 Scruggs was the handiest of all handymen. You could ask any of

 his customers and they would tell you there was nothing he couldn't

 fix. Whether it was a broken vase, a leaky pipe, Or a

 shaky banister, Eli always knew how to get the job done. But

 sadly, the man who had fixed so many things for the residents

 of Wisteria Lane was now about to break their hearts. Eli Scruggs,

 get down from there! Mrs. McCluskey. Just found this note in my

 mailbox. Says you're retiring? What the hell? Yes, ma'am. It's true. Now

 why would you want to do something stupid like that? My doc

 says I got a bum ticker. Have to take it easy from

 now on. Well, once I'm done fixing Mrs. Mayer's shingle, I'm on

 a plane to Waikiki. Well, this is very annoying. Who's going to

 fix my water heater when it breaks? Oh. I met this young

 guy, named Toby. Very bright. Just turned 30. - He'll take care

 of you. - Damn it, Eli! I am not comfortable with strangers

 in my house. - Took me 10 years to trust you. -

 I know. Most of those guys leave tools and nails all over

 the place. You never leave a mess. Thank you, ma'am. Have you

 told everyone else you're leaving? I left copies of that same note

 in everybody's mailbox. Well, that's not right. After all these years, people

 will want to say goodbye, and maybe throw you a party or

 something. Oh, no. I'd prefer to go quietly, if you know what

 I mean. I don't want a big fuss. Well, I'll miss you,

 Eli. There will never be another one like you. With that, Eli

 Scruggs climbed his ladder for the very last time. And once he

 had finished making his last repair, Eli Scruggs, quietly, with no fuss,

 had a heart attack and died. And, most importantly, without leaving a

 mess. It took an hour for someone to finally notice the body

 laying atop Susan Mayer's roof. It was less than 10 minutes later

 that the neighbors began arriving, each determined to get a look at

 the various paramedics and policemen who were all frantically trying to figure

 out exactly how to bring the body down. And it took two

 days for my friends to realize this tragedy had affected them... We're

 ready. Come on. ...more than they were willing to admit. Hey, Gabby,

 did you remember to get change? Because when I cash in my

 chips, I don't want to hear you say, \"All I've got is

 50s.\" Speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when Eli's funeral

 is? Oh. I think it's Saturday. I wonder how many people are

 going to show up. Mrs. McCluskey was saying he didn't have much

 family. Poor Eli. We should make sure he's got flowers at his

 funeral. I'm in. How much are we talking? I don't know. What

 do you think, Gabby? Gabby? Wow, Jimmy Choo! Oh, Carlos. These aren't

 even in the States yet. What's the catch? What are you talking

 about? You never buy me a present unless I'm mad or about

 to be mad. And I don't think I am, so why am

 I about to be? - I have to go to Cleveland tomorrow.

 - Carlos! They're begging me. The merger's going south. You just got

 home! With shoes. Don't leave me here. I'm going out of my

 mind. Everyone is so boring and suburban. And how many fricking honor

 students can that school have? Can we please not argue in front

 of the handyman? He has a name. - What's your name? -

 Eli Scruggs. You hear that, Carlos? You've brought me to a place

 where people are named Eli Scruggs. Fine, I'll give up my job.

 And everything that comes with it. Not the Jimmy Choos! They're the

 only friends I've got. Thought so. I'm going to pack. - You

 know, it's none of my business... - You're right, it's not. ...but

 the ladies in this neighborhood are actually pretty nice. Yeah, they came

 by, brought muffins. One of them wants her basket back. That'd be

 Bree. Anyhow, she and the other ladies play poker every week. If

 you'd like, I could talk to them, see if they'll let you

 host a game. Hi. We're, um, the neighborhood. Gabrielle invited us to

 play poker. So, is she in? Mrs. Solis will be right down.

 She likes to make an entrance. What does that mean, an entrance?

 Hello, there. Welcome to my home. Oh. That's what it means. So

 I said, \"Pumpkin...\" That's what I call Jon Bon Jovi. I said,

 \"Pumpkin, even if I could steer a yacht, \"I'm certainly not about

 to do it in five-inch heels.\" True story. Well, you've certainly had

 quite a glamorous life. That was before my husband moved me here

 to East Nowhere. Seriously, I don't know how you girls do it.

 - Do what? - Get out of bed in the morning. I've

 only lived here a month and I want to put a gun

 to my head. - You know what I mean? - No, we

 don't. There are no good nightclubs, no theater. - What do you

 do for a good time? - Well, we watch the kids play

 soccer. And the school drama department puts on some really great shows.

 And then there's church, of course. Church. Oh, you're serious. Look, I

 know it's quiet here, but I think you'll find there's a real

 charm to Fairview. No, no, no, it's cute. It's cute. I get

 that. It's just, I was a top-tier fashion model, and I guess

 I'm just going to have to get used to the fact that

 the best part of my life is behind me. Goodbye doing vodka

 shots with Kate Moss, and hello to sipping International Coffee with you

 girls. Full house. - Yes? - Hello, is Mrs. Solis here? Oh,

 I got it, I got it. Go, go, go, go, go. Ma'am,

 here's the bill for fixing your sink. Okay. Thank you. By the

 way, you made quite an impression at the poker game. - Really?

 - Oh, yeah. The ladies can't stop talking about you. Oh. Well,

 I'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a

 star in their midst. Let me think, did they say \"star\"? I

 heard, \"stuck-up, obnoxious, bitch...\" What? You know, I went out on a

 limb to get you into that game. And then you go in

 there acting like you're better than they are. My clothes said that,

 not me. Well, did you ask them anything about their lives? Why

 would they want to talk about their lives? Their lives are boring!

 Well, you know what's going to be really boring? You, sitting here

 alone in this big house without any friends. If I were you,

 I'd drop the attitude, learn to like your neighbors. Well, thanks for

 the advice. You want to add that to your bill? No. It's

 on the house. I brought muffins. That's so nice. We were just...

 Playing poker, and I wasn't invited. I know. I get it. I

 just wanted to tell you guys, I know I made a horrible

 first impression. Now you know why models don't usually talk. Because we

 say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to

 avoid us. What I should have said was, my husband's never home.

 I miss the city, I miss my life. I'm lonely all the

 time, and I could really use some friends. Anyway, here. Now that's

 how you make an entrance. - Gabby? - I'm sorry. What? We're

 getting a wreath for Eli's funeral. Are you in? Actually, why don't

 you let me pay for it? - It could still be from

 all of us. - No, you don't have to do that. I

 sort of do. Now let's play some poker. All right, time for

 my luck to change. This hand is for Eli. Hmm. Next hand

 is for Eli. You know, if we're going to have a get-together

 after the funeral, we should start thinking about food. And by \"we\"

 and \"food\" you mean Bree, right? I thought that was clear. I'd

 be happy to. Any special requests? How about we pick something from

 your cookbook? Great. Gabby, do you have your copy? I'll go get

 it. You use my cookbook to balance your table? Oh, it's only

 temporary. Juanita needed her coloring book back. All right. Watch out, ladies.

 Just telling you, I've got a pair of something. I'm sorry if

 the frittata's a bit dry. Mmm. Are you kidding? It's great. You

 should give Lynette the recipe. Yes, because that's what women in their

 eighth month really crave. More stove time. Mine is so erratic. I'm

 not even sure what the real temperature is. Of course, if a

 certain doctor would loosen the purse strings... We're not getting a new

 stove. If you would just take on a few more patients, we

 could afford it. Well, if I'm not supporting you adequately, my dear,

 by all means, feel free to do something about it. - Such

 as? - Well, you could maybe, I don't know, get a job?

 I have a job. I'm a homemaker. And a damn good one.

 So to make this, do you just saut? some ham and some

 onions, and... It's not happening, Tom. I just sometimes think maybe you

 would appreciate the value of a dollar more if you had to

 work outside the home. And I think you would appreciate my value

 more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and

 wash your own clothes. Lynette makes me sew my own buttons. I'll

 sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant. I

 want a new stove, Rex. And if I need to get a

 job to pay for it, so be it. If you're looking for

 a stove, we've got one that's hardly ever been used. I wish

 I could say the same for my uterus. Oh, yeah. I ruined

 the brunch. Hey, how's it looking under there, Eli? Is it going

 to cost me an arm and a leg? A few fingers, maybe.

 Honey, my stomach's growling. When's dinner? Oh. We're having leftovers. You can

 heat them up yourself if you want. Since when do we have

 leftovers? Since I started writing my own cookbook. Remember how you told

 me I should start making my own money? Well, I've been going

 through all my old recipes, and I've got this great idea for

 a real home-style American cookbook. - You're not serious. - Why wouldn't

 I be? People are always complimenting me on my cooking. You're great.

 But, come on, every bored housewife who pulls off a decent lasagna

 thinks she can write a cookbook. You think I'm just like every

 other housewife? No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying. It's just

 that, What do you really know about writing? I'll learn. And I

 want it to be more than just a cookbook. I want to

 talk about traditional values, and give helpful hints about homemaking. Look, look,

 this is my fault. You know, I was ribbing you the other

 day about getting a job. And you took it seriously. If you

 really want a new stove, I'll get you a stove. Now, can

 you stop this foolishness and make me something to eat that isn't

 leftovers? Mrs. Van De Kamp? I fixed your banister. Should be fine

 now. I'll just go. You can pay me whenever. I know this

 is a rough time for you. Thanks, Eli. By the way, service

 for Mr. V was really nice. You were there? Yeah, I sat

 in the back of the church. I wanted to say goodbye to

 Mr. V. So, have you thought about what you're going to do

 now? You mean, with my life? I don't know. Mrs. V, I've

 been meaning to give this to you for a while now, but

 I could never find the right moment. I kept it for you

 just in case you might need it someday. Hope you don't mind.

 I've got to tell you, I made your Cajun meatloaf. That may

 be my favorite meal ever. I can't believe you saved this. Aw.

 Of course, I'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook

 right now. Well, maybe one day you will be. Hey, Bree, I

 know what you can make for the wake. That flaky-breaded-shrimp thing. Thanks,

 but I know exactly what I'm going to make. Dave, it was

 a nice trip, but I've got to tell you, I don't know

 why we spent all that money going to the Bahamas. If we're

 not going to leave the hotel room, then why not just cover

 ourselves is suntan lotion and have sex here. You just got a

 message from Mrs. McCluskey. Oh? She said your handyman died. Eli? Oh,

 my God. He was working on Susan's roof and dropped dead of

 a heart attack. Can you believe that? No, no, no. You are

 not going to the gym again. You said we were going to

 have afternoon sex. We'll do it when I get back. You say

 that every time, Umberto. And then you're too tired. Maybe I wouldn't

 be if you weren't so clingy. Clingy? We haven't had sex in

 two weeks! It's like I'm 15 again. - What's wrong with us?

 - Not us. You. Your libido is out of control. - Umberto.

 - Look, you've got a drawer full of toys. Use them. Oh.

 Eli. I forgot you were in there. Yeah, I'm done fixing your

 faucet. Actually, I was done 10 minutes ago, but I was afraid

 to come out. I'm sorry you heard all of that. The good

 news is, while I was in there I re-grouted your tub. Free

 of charge. Wait a second. What do you think of my ass?

 - Sorry? - My ass. On a scale from one to 10.

 - Well, I... I... I... - Tick, tock! Ten. It's a 10.

 And the boobs? Perky and Firm? You've named them? Oh, come on,

 Eli, my husband won't have sex with me. I just need to

 make sure it's not me. - It's not you. - Are you

 sure? Trust me, I used to work in construction. My buddies would

 have gone crazy for you. Cat calls, nasty gestures. \"Hey, you with

 the sweater meats! \"You ever need any work done, call me, \"because

 I've got the perfect tool for the job.\" - You get the

 drift. - Yeah, I do. That was insulting and demeaning. Oh... Thank

 you so much. Ms. Britt? Your door was wide open. Got the

 paint. You want to check the color? - Is everything okay? -

 Things are great. You want some wine? We're celebrating. - What's the

 occasion? - I am no longer married to a gay guy! Umberto

 was gay? So you wasted your time installing that light in the

 closet, because he went flying out of there. - At least you

 know now it wasn't you. - Wasn't it? He said that being

 married to me was what convinced him that he liked men. You

 could imagine what a boost to the ego that was. Come on,

 you've had a gay guy sleeping with you for two years. And

 those guys are pretty hard to land. No, no, trust me. No

 need to be sad. You're a knockout. I need this hand back.

 It's hard to be a handyman without a hand. Ms. Britt, what

 are you doing? You put the mirror over my bed. You know

 exactly what I'm doing. Are you sure about this? I don't want

 to take advantage of you. Oh, I'm sure you'll be gentle. Anyway,

 I guess they're burying him on Saturday. - Obviously, you want to

 go. - Yeah. I do. Oh. Leave that black dress out. I'll

 get it dry cleaned for the funeral. A little sexy for a

 funeral, isn't it? I don't think Eli would mind. Mom? That's Penny.

 I'll be right back. Mom! Hey, sweetie. What's up? You said you

 would help me with my math. We're dividing fractions. Oh. I wish

 you'd caught me two chardonnays ago. Mom, you promised. I know, but

 Mommy's still planning Eli's memorial. Start without me. I'll be there in

 a little while. Oh, my gosh, Lynette, are you okay? The doctor

 just called. I'm pregnant. What? This is fantastic! You... Yeah, whoop-de-doo! Honey,

 you don't sound too happy about this. I was planning to go

 back to work. What? What are you talking about? I had it

 in the back of my mind for a while. - And then

 yesterday I got a phone... - Hold it. Sorry. I was having

 trouble paying attention. Jeffrey Cuevas is retiring in September. I am the

 perfect person to step into his job. And that is exactly when

 Parker starts kindergarten. The timing is like a dream. But what about

 our dream of having a little girl? - This could be our

 chance. - Oh, please. You know it's going to be a boy.

 It's always a boy. It's just going to pee in my face

 and hide dead things in my shoes. I am doing this, Tom.

 I am going after this job. But who's going to take care

 of the kids? Well, I was hoping you could cut back on

 your hours at work. I can't do that. I have a career.

 - You did not just say that. - No. I didn't. I

 didn't. Tom, I cannot just stay at home wiping noses. I need

 it for my sanity. And I need you to back me up.

 Well, the kids are up. They're going to want their breakfast. And

 I'm going to back you up by making it for them. My

 hero. Jeff Cuevas is fantastic, but I know I can take his

 department to a whole new level. - What the hell is that?

 - Oh, my water broke. Take the overnight bag out to the

 car. Oh. Three weeks, that's a little soon, but, uh, sure. I

 could make that work. For God's sake, Lynette! We've got to go

 to the hospital. In a minute. I'm trying to lock this job

 down. What kind of perks are we talking about here? Okay, you're

 having contractions? That's it. Give me... I swear, if you touch this

 phone, I will have this baby right here and then beat you

 with it. You're insane. We have to go. Could you hold on

 one second? We agreed I could go back to work after I

 gave birth. After, Lynette. Not during! I'm sorry, is there any way

 we could finish this conversation tomorrow? Oh! Later in the day works

 better for me, too. Well, thank you very much. Bye. Hey, I

 got the job! Congratulations. The baby's arm is sticking out, why don't

 you high-five it? Tom, I am in pain. Do you mind? You'll

 see, Tom. I know people say that you... You can't have it

 all, but I know we can. Oh, Mr. Swenson, I can't tell

 you how excited I am. Maybe you could schedule a staff meeting

 so I could hit the ground running on Monday. No, no. No,

 it can't be Friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start

 next week. So, again, thank you so much for this opportunity. Yeah.

 Mrs. Scavo, I think you might have forgotten something. Could you hold

 on a second? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I was on

 the phone, I was talking to my new boss and, I... She

 was only in there for a minute. But it's 85 degrees outside.

 I've never done this before! Well, you've got a lot on your

 mind. Three kids and a newborn, sounds like a new job. -

 Yeah, I do. - Yeah. That's a lot to handle. There you

 go. I should probably get back to Susan's windows. You take care.

 MR. SWANS ON ON PHONE: Lynette, are you still there? Lynette? Hello?

 Are you still there? Hey, you coming back in? No. I'm going

 to go help my daughter with her homework. Hey, Penny! Wait up!

 Yard sale! Oh, good, you're here! - How are you, Eli? -

 Fine. - You? - Great. Yeah, I haven't worn these jeans in

 a while and I found 20 bucks in the pocket! Don't you

 just love when that happens? Also, Karl left me for his secretary,

 so I need you to change these locks. - Oh. I'm so

 sorry. - Oh. Thanks, but don't be. Just hurry. Karl said he

 was coming by to get some of his stuff, and I want

 this place to be a fortress by then. - You're doing all

 right, though? - Oh. Well, on one hand, I got dumped for

 a pair of headlights named Brandy. On the other, I reported Karl's

 credit cards stolen and I cut the pockets out of all of

 his pants. So, a little from column A, a little from column

 B. Oh, sorry. Well, if it's any consolation, redheads are nuts. What

 do you mean? She'll make his life a living hell, which sounds

 like what he deserves. Brandy's not a redhead. She's a blonde. So,

 uh, you maybe want to go with a deadbolt this time? What

 do you know? I saw him around town a couple times with

 a redhead. Uh, people in the neighborhood were talking. I thought you

 knew. I didn't. Would you feel any better knowing that she's kind

 of chubby? Just leave. But what about the locks? If Karl's coming...

 Change the locks, then leave. Okay. But I really am sorry. Change

 the locks, don't talk to me, then leave. Susan? Susan, did you

 call me? I couldn't really understand the message. Oh, wow. You want

 me to come back later? Are you all right? No, of course

 you're not. I heard you and Mike are getting divorced. I'm sorry.

 Probably not what you want to hear, but I thought you were

 a great couple. Thanks. That's sweet. Do you maybe remember what you

 wanted me to do? - Locks. - Change the locks. Got it.

 Let me go see what I've got out in the truck. Susan,

 I don't know much about love. I've dabbled in it once or

 twice, but it always seemed more trouble than it was worth. Told

 myself I wasn't missing much. But watching you all these years, how

 hard you've tried, how... How hurt you've been, but you still keep

 getting back up, you dust yourself off and you try again... Maybe

 I am missing something. Maybe... Maybe it is worth it. And I'm

 sure it's not going to help for you to hear me tell

 you this, but you're damn heroic to me. You are. Yeah. Hey.

 Just dropping these off. Finally got them cut. Tell Jackson I'm sorry

 it took me so long. Actually, um, Jackson and I split up.

 I'm sorry. - Am I sorry? - Oh, yeah. He's a great

 guy. I just want to be alone right now. Well, good for

 you. Oh. Hey, as long as you're here, I think there's a

 loose shingle on my roof. Do you think maybe you could fix

 it for me? Oh. I'd be happy to. But just so you

 know, it'll be the last thing I ever fix for you. I'm

 retiring. - What? - Yep. Today's my last day. You can't retire.

 I break too many things. I know. You paid for the trip

 to Hawaii I'm going to take. No, this is the right move.

 Be happy for me. Hey, I am happy for you. It's just,

 um... This is going to sound crazy. - What? - Um... I

 think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life.

 You're so stable and reliable, and I just always thought you'd be

 around. Which is funny, because I don't really know anything about you.

 Well, how about this. I'll fix your shingle, and when I'm done,

 you can ask me anything you want. Great! I will go to

 the store right now and get some wine so we can toast

 your retirement. I'd like that. Perfect way to end my time on

 Wisteria Lane. Oh, hey. What kind do you like? Red or white?

 Either one. Just make sure it's a screw-top. Eli Scruggs was buried

 on a Saturday. And all the people that Eli had helped over

 the years came to pay their last respects. But one person was

 missing. Someone who had changed Eli's life in a way he never

 forgot. Excuse me, ma'am. - Hope I'm not interrupting your day. -

 Not at all. Can I help you? I was hoping I could

 help you. I'm a handyman. Just moved into town, looking for work.

 Sorry. I... I don't have anything that needs fixing. Well, if you

 ever do, uh, here's my card. Eli Scruggs. What a distinctive name.

 Well, people do seem to remember. So if any of your friends

 need help, I can do pretty much anything. I don't know. Um...

 If you have an extra card or two, I could hand them

 out. Oh, I'd really appreciate that. Anyway, thank you for your time.

 I have a broken vase. - I'm sorry? - I was dusting

 the other day, and knocked it off the bureau like an idiot.

 Anyway, I saved the pieces. If you could glue it back together

 for me, I'd really appreciate it. Oh. Ma'am, you don't have to

 do that. Mr. Scruggs, I need my vase fixed. It means a

 lot to me. Now you're not going to make me beg, are

 you? No, ma'am. I'm not. Good. Come on in. Mrs. Young? Oh.

 Didn't mean to disturb you. Your front door was wide open. Oh.

 Eli, I don't have any work for you today. I'm just here

 to drop off that handle you wanted. Finally found one that matched.

 - Want me to install it? - Not today. Okay. I'll just

 be going then. Eli, wait. What? - Do you remember this? -

 Oh, right. This is the very first thing you ever fixed for

 me. Yeah, that must have been, what, two years ago? - I

 guess that glue really held, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. I want you

 to have it. What? Why? I've just been doing some thinking about

 the people I know. The ones who've walked into my life and

 made it better than it was before. People like you. Anyway, I've

 never said thank you. Oh, no, I'm the one who should thank

 you. You introduced me to all your friends. My business couldn't be

 better. - I'm so glad. - Yeah. Anyway, I want you to

 have this. Gee... Mrs. Young, are you all right? Everything's fine. Are

 you sure? You should go now. So, I look in the window

 and there's blood everywhere. All over the walls and the ceiling, not

 to mention her hardwood floors, which she just had installed last week.

 I don't know what she was thinking. I just wish there'd been

 some warning, some sign that she would do such a thing. Eli

 Scruggs sat in his truck for almost an hour, devastated that he

 had done nothing to save me. He then made a quiet vow

 to God. From that moment forward, he would do what he could

 to help people, to help them fix their lives. And for the

 rest of his life, that's exactly what he did. It was a

 lovely service. Eli would've liked it. Hell of a turnout. Who knew

 he had so many friends? I'm not surprised. He was a good

 man. I can't help feeling there's more we could have done to

 honor him. Well, let's just make sure we remember him. Eli would

 have said that's more than most people get. And he would've been

 right. As usual. Wait. I wanted to fix something for Eli, for

 a change. And somewhere in a place reserved for the very best
