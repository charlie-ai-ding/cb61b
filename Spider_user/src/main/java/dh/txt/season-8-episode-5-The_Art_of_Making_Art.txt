 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... After an incident at school... Aah! Gaby was forced

 to replace the P.T.A. President. Me? Carlos was struggling with his guilt.

 This is not me. I can't sleep. I'm seeing ghosts. I know.

 Susan found a way to cope. I'm taking a painting class being

 taught by Andre Zeller. Great. But the famous painter didn't make it

 easy. You're a bored housewife trying to kill time between spin class

 and driving your kid to soccer practice. And Lynette discovered that since

 their separation, Tom had started dating. It's just a couple of dinners

 and... coffee. God, Tom. When were you gonna tell me this? In

 their 20 years together, Tom and Lynette Scavo had followed a few

 simple rules... Always share the housework... Never waste the hot water, and

 never, ever go to bed angry. Yes, the rules for being together

 were simple. But the rules for being apart... Were anything but. Stop

 calling it \"dating.\" It's dinner with a friend. Do not do that.

 Do not do the snort. Could you make her stop snorting? Lynette,

 I find it more effective when we use words rather than inflammatory

 noises. You want words? Here are some words. Liar, liar, pants on

 fire. Lobster for two at Chez Nous is not \"dinner with a

 friend.\" A $300 night at Sakura is not strapping on a feedbag

 with a buddy. I still do our credit card bills, genius. All

 right, enough words. Hey, it's not like I went looking for this.

 Jane lives in the building. We got to talking. You know what?

 She was actually nice to me... something I'm not used to. Oh,

 I can't snort, but a drive-by like that's okay? All right, emotions

 are running a little hot, but I think I know why. You

 two embarked on this separation without a clear goal in mind. Are

 you trying to get back together, or are you trying to find

 a graceful way to end the marriage? We don't have to decide

 this right now, but we do need to lay down some ground

 rules. For example, are you dating? He is. Two dinners. All right,

 so you are dating. What about sex? No. Not yet. I-I... He

 just answered your first question. He wants to end the marriage. No,

 Lynette, that's not what I'm saying. I'm not giving up. \"Not yet\"?

 Look, I still hope that we can find a way to work

 things out, but... We don't make each other happy. We haven't for

 a long time. So what if... I mean, what if there was

 someone out there who could? I just feel like if we don't...

 Explore... Then we are gonna end up right back in here, on

 this couch, hating each other. Sounds like you have a lot to

 consider. There's nothing to consider. We're... cleared for sex. Let the dating

 begin. Yes, Tom and Lynette were learning the rules of separation. And

 the first rule? And I can't wait to let my new boyfriend

 do that thing I never let you do. There are no rules.

 Desperate Housewives 8x05 The Art of Making Art www.SUBTITULOS.es -DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-

 In any group, there are roles that people are destined to play...

 the perfect homemaker to bring the snacks, the financial wizard to keep

 the books... And the busybody to share the gossip. But sometimes the

 most important role of all goes to someone who's not the slightest

 bit prepared for it. Hi, guys. I know, I'm a little bit

 late. A little? Try 45 minutes. Well, once you hear what I've

 been through, you will totally understand. So... you know how it's called

 a hot stone massage? So there I am at the spa, laid

 out with my mojito, my \"Marie Claire,\" and all of a sudden,

 I feel a cold rock on my ass. I know! So Armando

 was all apologetic. He wanted to reheat the rocks. But at this

 point, I'm like, \"I'm sorry. I've got a P.T.A. Meeting to run.\"

 If you left, why are you late? Oh, Armando felt so bad,

 he gave me a complimentary seaweed wrap. So... what's on the agenda

 here? We're supposed to plan teacher appreciation night. Mm. Right, right. So

 who's doing what for that? Cindy, you wanna handle the food? No.

 Okay. Rachel, you never stop talking. You wanna emcee? No. Okay, what's

 going on here? What's going on is you've wasted our time. I'm

 leaving. I have to pick up my kids. I have to get

 back to my job. I need to take my mother to chemo.

 Wh... okay, okay. Let's not play sad-life poker here. I need your

 help. You know, we would love to fritter away our days with

 manicures and hairdressers and spa appointments, but we're not like you. We

 have lives. So you can do teacher appreciation night on your own.

 Wh... Well, could you at least fold up your chairs and Stack

 'em on the rolling cart? And can someone empty the coffeepot? You'd

 really do... Jeez! Talk about selfish. Oh, thank goodness. You're alive. I'm

 sorry, reverend. I know that I haven't been to church for a

 few Sundays. A few? Try five. You know who's been bringing snacks

 to fellowship hour? Helen Johnson. Ugh. Let me guess. Bran muffins from

 the mini-mart? Why hast thou forsaken me? I should've called you. It's

 just, I haven't been feeling... Very spiritual lately. It's not uncommon for

 us to lose our way spiritually from time to time, to feel...

 In the woods. Interesting choice of words. It's just that I... Feel

 like maybe I'm not worthy of... God's love right now, that... I've

 lost my connection to him. But here's the good thing about God,

 Bree... he's easy to find. Just seek out the people who are

 in need, and there he is. It always comes back to the

 needy with you, doesn't it? It's kind of in the job description.

 I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner does wonderful work with the

 homeless. Why don't you speak to him? Perhaps I will. Thank you,

 reverend. I did mention that Helen's doing the snacks, right? Ah. I

 just finished a batch of macadamia nut scones. Would you like one?

 Bless you, my child. And maybe one for the car? I get

 so nervous every time I walk into this class. I mean, Andre

 Zeller, right? Between you and me, he doesn't think I'm a serious

 artist. But I'll show him. I have pain. I mean, like this

 morning, my 9-year-old walked right into school without even saying good-bye. No

 hug, no kiss. Nothing. Well, I'm gonna take that misery and use

 it in my art. I'm using my father's suicide. Today we'll be

 working with light and shadow. Ooh! Eggs. Cool. Ms. Delfino, this is

 my breakfast. You will not be sketching eggs or any other hackneyed

 still lifes today. You'll be drawing the male form. Emile. Whoa! Sorry.

 Takes some... getting used to. As you begin to sketch, think of

 the human form as an object. What is it that catches your

 eye? Mm. Didn't mean it. Just popped out. I want you to

 pay close attention to which parts of the human body reflect light

 and which parts cast a shadow. I'm sorry, Ms. Delfino. I didn't

 realize we were in junior high. Have you never seen a penis

 before? No. No. Yes, I have. Uh, lots. Well, not lots. The

 appropriate... amount. Please try to be professional. I am. I am professional.

 Penis, penis, penis. Just trying to take the power out of it.

 Quick. Tell me about your father's suicide. Hey. What are you doing?

 Uh... I was, uh, looking for my phone, and, uh... I know

 this is gonna sound stupid, but... I couldn't go in there. Oh,

 God. I don't mean to sound insensitive, but is this dead guy

 angst? 'Cause I am really pooped right now. It's just, every time

 I go into that room, I think about that night. Well, here's

 an idea. Don't go in that room. Look, there's the kitchen. No

 one died in there. You know what? We're both stressed. I'll pour

 us a couple of drinks. No, thanks. I've been hitting that stuff

 pretty hard lately. I don't want it to become a thing. Well,

 after the day I had, I'll finish the bottle myself. This P.T.A.

 Gig is turning into a serious pain in the ass. Yeah. I

 show up the teensiest bit late, and the girls are all over

 me. They're like, \"Gaby, why are you late? You should be sad

 and miserable and on time, just like us.\" It's like they're jealous

 or something. Oh, my God. They're jealous. I know what to do.

 Thanks for listening. It's nothing fancy, but, uh, I'm proud to say

 we feed hundreds of homeless people every day. Oh. Wonderful. This is

 exactly what I'm looking for. Well, great. But, uh, just out of

 curiosity... Uh, what did you do? Excuse me? Well, when most people

 wanna give back, it usually means they've done something they're, uh, ashamed

 of. You know, embezzlement, adultery. What's your story? I suppose I could

 ask you the same thing. And I'd have the good sense not

 to answer. Mm-hmm. I've just been feeling disconnected lately, and I thought

 by doing something meaningful with my days that I could change that.

 Actual selflessness. That's refreshing. I wish the city council was as enlightened

 as you. Oh? Ah, they're holding up one of my developments 'cause

 it includes low-income housing. Ah. Typical \"not in my backyard\" attitude. By

 the way... It's not in your backyard. Uh, I'm gonna have to

 take this. But, uh, I will leave you in the capable hands

 of, uh, Donnie here. Excuse me. Hello? Who are you? Oh, I

 am Bree, your humble sous chef. What do you need me to

 do? Prep? Saute? Chop? You wanna prep? Start prepping. That's... it? Oh,

 I forgot to show you the spice rack. Here you go. Salt.

 Pepper. And we're out of pepper. If I may, have you ever

 considered making the soup from scratch? We don't have time for that.

 Just get 'em in and get 'em out. Yes, because we all

 know how pressed for time the homeless are. Look, these people may

 not have homes, but they do have taste buds. Would you be

 offended if I tried whipping up a batch of homemade soup? Can

 you get it done by noon? Oh, dear. I guess I'll have

 to keep it simple. It's just a rustic acorn squash bisque finished

 with a dot of maple-infused creme fraiche and a little crumble of

 fried sage. Holy crap! Finally, a blurb for my next cookbook. I

 understand that some of you are uncomfortable with the naked body, maybe

 even find it laughable. Mr. Zeller, I'm so sorry. One cannot create

 real art if one is crippled by one's own inhibitions. I'm gonna

 strip them away. So... for our next class, we're not gonna have

 nude models. Phew. We're gonna have nude painters. What? Painting in the

 nude will force you to create from a place of total honesty.

 And if you're serious about being an artist, you shouldn't have a

 problem with it. Nope. No problem at all. What's going on, Gaby?

 Yeah. Why'd you call us here? I just want to apologize for

 what happened at the last meeting. Keep talkin'. It was wrong of

 me to blow you off for a spa appointment when you have

 such busy lives. Message received, loud and clear. Thank you. So to

 show you I've taken your complaint to heart, may I present my

 beauty team! Armando, the best masseuse in town, Kay, my hairdresser, and

 Ping on nails. You no longer have to be jealous of my

 fabulous life. For one day, you can be me. My treat. Go

 crazy. Wow. Good to know you got our message. You're welcome. So

 you think you might want to reconsider doing the food? I'd love

 to. Uh, I'll handle decorations. Yeah, whatever you need from us. That's

 more like it. Now today, relax. Take a break from grocery shopping

 and spanking. I have to go meet my travel agent. Are you

 guys serious? Are we really helping her? No. We're helping ourselves to

 a free spa day, then we're going to leave her twisting in

 the wind. Oh! Hey, ladies, anyone know of a good hotel in

 the south of France? I'm sorry. I did it again! I'm sorry.

 I'm sorry. Hey, Lynette, did I leave those fabric samples? Busted! That

 is a porn slam if I've ever seen one. Porn? Mm. No.

 I was checking my e-mail. Come on. It's okay. We all look

 at porn. What are you into? Straight, bi, solo, bald guys, fuzzy

 whispers, cinnamon cakes, poodling? Do I have to learn what those are?

 'Cause I really don't want to know. Oh, come on. Let me

 see. I promise I will not judge. No. I signed up for

 an online dating service, and I took a stab at my introduction

 video. Hi, I'm Lynette. I'm 35 to 45-ish. I'm a cancer, and

 I beat cancer. Coincidence or not? You decide. That is more disturbing

 than any porn I've ever seen. You said you wouldn't judge. Oh!

 Online dating sucks. It's full of guys who Photoshop hair on their

 heads and crop out their man boobs. You want to meet men?

 I'm taking you to a bar. A bar? Oh, I don't know.

 It's been 25 years since I tried to pick up a guy.

 Well, with me as your wingwoman, you can have any man you

 want. Friday okay? I thought you had a date with Ben. Mm.

 He canceled. Again. Some stupid real estate development for the poor. Bastard.

 Well, his loss. If he doesn't appreciate what he's got, I will

 find someone who does. Oh, and lay off the ice cream. There's

 no Photoshop in real life. Morning. What's for breakfast? Eggs. I was

 gonna make bacon, but it seemed a little risky. Susan, you get

 upset if I take my socks off in the kitchen. What's going

 on? Andre feels \"until we shed our inhibitions, our art will be

 only superficial.\" Anyway, for our next class, we have to paint in

 the nude. So I'm trying to get used to it. And I

 want to prove to him that I can be a real artist.

 Wow, that guy is good. He gets to see a bunch of

 coeds naked and call it work. Oh, honey, I'm kidding. No, I

 can't do it. I'm not a naked person. Maybe I'm not a

 real artist either. - Susan. - No, I mean it. Andre doesn't

 like any of my work. I'm not serious like the other students.

 I think I'm just gonna quit the class. Quit? But this class

 has been really good for you. It seems like it was pulling

 you out of that dark place you've been in. You think so?

 Yeah, and I feel like I'm getting my old Susie back. Besides,

 this guy sounds like a jackass. Don't let him win. You're right.

 I am a serious artist. I just need to get used to

 people seeing me naked. Susan! It's Lee. You home? Perfect. My best

 gay. Who better to practice on? Good morning, Lee. This is Bob's...

 mother of God! Ohh! Gay marriage doesn't seem so freaky now, does

 it? Looks like my tuscan bean with parmesan crostini is a hit.

 Yeah, it is, but I think you're starting to attract the wrong

 sort of crowd. Excuse me, but, uh, you don't exactly look homeless

 to me. Yeah, I-I'm homeless. And yet you have a $2,000 laptop?

 But I live ithe box it came in? Okay, I-I'm a college

 student. But my parents did stop talking to me when I switched

 from pre-med to creative writing. Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to

 leave. Too bad. I just gave you mad props on my blog.

 Is that a good thing? Yeah. \"Homey but refined, \"Bree Van de

 Camp's tuscan bean soup is a revelation in a bowl.\" Revelation, you

 say? Uh-huh. And it's already been \"liked\" on Facebook and retweeted 200

 times... Which is also a good thing. Oh. But hey, if I

 gotta go... Hold on. I can't let a talented near-orphan like you

 go hungry. Let me get you a refill. Oh, and it's \"Van

 de Kamp\"... With a \"k.\" Hey, Mike. Need a hand? No, I'm

 okay. Uh, Susan around? Uh, she's at her painting class. Okay. I'll...

 stop by later. I don't think that's a good idea. You need

 to say something to me, Mike? Yeah, I do. If things were

 different, if it had been me that killed somebody, and your wife

 walked in, I'd have gone to the cops and turned myself in.

 I wouldn't have dragged Gaby into it. There's a lot I would've

 done differently about that night if I could. Yeah, well, you can't.

 But here's what you can do... you can leave Susan alone. Just

 let her find a way to deal with what you put her

 through. It just really helps to talk to her. But it doesn't

 help her. Then... I won't do it anymore. Yeah. Remember, technique is

 a crutch. Learn it and throw it away. That way you can

 begin to find your own voice and that's what that... Oh, my

 God. Oh! Taking casual Friday a bit to the extreme, aren't we,

 Ms. Delfino? Isn't this the day we were... Aren't we all supposed

 to be... The school put the kibosh on my little artistic experiment.

 It was all there in the e-mail. What e-mail? The one you

 obviously didn't open. Maybe you didn't send me one. Why would I

 do that? To humiliate me. To punish me for laughing. You have

 singled me out since day one. Why not try to make a

 fool of me? Because in the vast landscape of my interior life,

 you're merely a dust speck. Now get dressed and sit down. No.

 I signed up for this class to learn something, not to be

 a punching bag for an egomaniac with a paintbrush! I quit! Hello

 and welcome to our soup kitchen. I hope you're hungry, because I

 have prepared a hearty Italian wedding soup today. Donnie, two. Reverend Sykes.

 What a nice surprise! That's quite a crowd out front. I practically

 had to fight my way in. Well, ever since I took over

 the kitchen, we've been jam-packed. Thank you so much for suggesting I

 get involved. I have never felt more needed or important in my

 whole life. The intention of charity is not to make us feel

 important. Of course not. It's to help people. Feeling important's just a

 bonus. So what brings you by? I was hoping you could tell

 me where a homeless person could get a hot meal. Well, right

 here, of course. No, Bree. Ever since you've turned this soup kitchen

 into a bisque kitchen, the homeless don't feel comfortable here. Why? I

 was just trying to make this place special. It was already special.

 It was home for them, until you took that away. Excuse me.

 I'm sorry, but you're gonna need to leave. Hey, we're still eating.

 Well, then go eat somewhere else. You certainly look like you can

 afford to. Whoa. Where's the attitude coming from? We made is place

 a success. No. This place is supposed to feed homeless people. It's

 a dismal failure. This food isn't for you. It's for the hungry

 and the poor... the people we walk past every day. Everyone deserves

 to have a place, and this place was theirs until I made

 it mine. So please, pack up your laptops and your smartphones and

 go. Please go. Ben, I'm sorry. I have made a terrible mess

 of things. Don't worry about it. You think you can make a

 speech that good again tomorrow? Speech? You're gonna help me push that

 low-income housing project through city council. This is where you live, huh?

 Norman Rockwell would walk down this street and say, \"a little much.\"

 Can I come in? Of course. How else are you gonna make

 fun of the inside of my house? By the way, I, uh,

 checked my e-mail, and, uh, you never sent me one. Did you

 check your campus e-mail? I have a campus e-mail? Okay, I'm gonna

 make this brief, mainly because I've got a dinner engagement with someone

 infinitely more interesting than you. Wow. Climb down from your cross and

 come back to my class. Why? So you can abuse me more?

 Yes, I will abuse you and scream at you, make you paint

 in the nude and do anything else I have to do to

 get you to stop being so scared. I'm not scared. I showed

 up at your class naked. Then you ran away. It seems to

 me you do a lot of running away and nervous giggling. Mm.

 You act like someone who's... What? You're hiding something, and I'm gonna

 pull it out of you, and when that happens, there is a

 chance... the remotest, slimmest wisp of a chance... that you might actually

 become an artist. Oh, God. Is this the part where you tell

 me that the reason you're being so hard on me is because

 I'm the only one in the class with potential. No. Amy Yamata's

 the only one in the class with potential. You're a bizarre car

 crash that somehow fascinates me. Thank you? Now if you'll excuse me,

 this is about as long as I can spend in a room

 decorated with ceramic elephants. Hi, ladies. Someone wanna help me with these

 flowers? Okay, no worries. I got it. What have you guys been

 doing? People are gonna be here in two hours. Nothing's been set

 up. Well, I'm just so relaxed from that massage. I'd hate to

 lift something and tense up again. Yeah, and... and Ping worked so

 hard on these nails. I would hate to chip them. And I...

 can't think of anything witty to say about my fabulous new 'do,

 but I'm not doing squat either. Why are you doing this to

 me? I went out of my way to help you people. Oh,

 my God, you are so out of touch. Do you really think

 a hot stone massage is gonna solve my problems? You don't understand

 the kinds of things real people deal with. You live in this

 perfect little fairy tale. Fine. I don't need your help. I have

 two hours and a very capable husband. This event is going off

 without a hitch. Oh, and one more thing. Hello? Honey, sorry to

 bother you at work, but this is an emergency. Whoa. What's going

 on? I need you to meet me at the school. These P.T.A.

 Beeyotches... yeah, I'm talking to you, Cindy... Are refusing to help me.

 I need an extra pair of hands. Sure. I'll be... be right

 there. Ha! He's on his way. Thanks. You're a lifesaver. Wow. When

 I pictured this in my head, I wasn't as old as all

 the other people... Combined. Uh, two martinis, dirty. Oh, wait. That's me.

 Feel free to use that if you want. Maybe I will... at

 home, 'cause that's where I'm going. Oh, relax. Look at this place

 like a candy store. You just have to figure out what you're

 in the mood for. Obviously, something with nuts. I thought I was

 done with this. I dated, I combed through all the losers, and

 I finally found a guy, someone who was smart and made me

 laugh. And now to be back here, at my age, doing it

 all over again, it's depressing. Oh, my God. You're right. What? -

 It is depressing. - Renee. What am I doing in hell's candy

 store? I have a guy. He's smart and he makes me laugh.

 I thought you said Ben works too much. Oh, he's passionate about

 his job, but he's a 10. You add up every guy in

 this place and you get a 6. But you stay. There's definitely

 somebody here for you. Orange cable... Goes around here... This one goes

 here. Ha! And... Presto! Oh! Ow. So is \"presto\" Spanish for \"cover

 your ears\"? That's hilarious, Cindy. You know, you should've been a comic

 instead of a pint-sized pain in my ass! Oh, it's getting late.

 Looks like your perfect husband isn't gonna be here to bail you

 out. Aha! Look who's here. There's my hero! Now hurry up. We

 need to get cracking here. Hey, what are you doing? Carlos. Hey,

 Gaby. Carlos, you can't be here like this. You've gotta go. No,

 no, no. Gonna help, okay? No. Please. You need to leave. No,

 I'm gonna help, okay? Gonna help. No, honey. You have to leave,

 please. Hang on. Hang on. Whew! Rachel, get the soundboard set up.

 Melissa, Megan, start putting out the food. Melissa, now. It's okay, Gaby.

 We got it. I don't know what to say. Just take care

 of your husband. Hello. I'm Phil, and you're beautiful. You're just saying

 that. But I'll take it. God knows it took me long enough

 to get ready tonight. I even had to pay the sitter to

 come early. Sitter? So you have kids? Yeah. Five. Five kids. Wow.

 That sounds like a lot. I actually have a husband, too, but

 we're separated, and we're seeing other people. Or he is, and I'm

 trying to. Not that I'm doing it to retaliate, it's just that...

 wow. I can't seem to stop talking. Maybe you could say something

 now. Bye. Bye-bye. Crowd's a little light tonight, don't you think? Can

 I buy you a drink or are you already lit? Oh, come

 on. I'll let you play with my tie. Here's the remote. Don't

 I know you from somewhere? Okay. Not the most original line, but

 you're cute, so... Lynette. Right. Right. You're Porter and Preston's mom. Oh,

 God. Mrs. Scavo was the coolest mom. She used to make us

 grilled cheese in the shape of dinosaurs. So what are you doing

 here? I have no idea. Here you go. It's probably the only

 set of keys with a purple lanyard. My kid made it at

 camp. Look, I'm wearing something called skinny jeans, which are very painful

 because I don't have something called skinny legs, so I just wanna

 go home and peel them off. Do you mind? No, not at

 all. I just... I don't... I don't work here. Oh. Oh, God.

 I'm sorry. You're not the valet. I knew this vest was a

 bad idea, but the gay guy in my office told me they're

 back. No, the vest is great. I have it in navy. It's

 just... I haven't been out in so long, I figured I'd try

 to mix things up. You haven't been out in so long? Last

 time I was at a bar like this, beeper numbers were exchanged.

 I didn't even know they banned smoking in bars. And how did

 the good, old, reliable Martini lose its job? Apple? Cherry? Watermelon? Those

 are slushie flavors. I'm Lynette. Scott. By the way, not that it's

 a competition, but I have two lanyards on my keychain. They're pink.

 - Daughters? - Yes. Divorce? No, thanks. I already had one. You?

 Uh, separated. Hey. Um... Listen, this is the first decent conversation I've

 had all night. What do you say we go back inside and

 continue it? I say... Pomegranatinis are on me. All right. That was

 easy. You calling me easy? Not yet. Um, please. Ah. Uh, can

 I get you something to drink? I have, uh, vodka. I have

 milk. I have chocolate milk. I have juice boxes. Having kids has

 really ruined my game, huh? Vodka and chocolate milk... that's exactly what

 I give my baby to calm her down. Cheers. Cheers. Now what

 do we do? I'd put on some music, but my ex got

 all my cds. Mm. I could turn on a black light, but

 I'm not 16. Maybe I could light some candles, but that seems

 like kind of an obvious move, right? Not as obvious as this.

 Maybe obvious isn't so bad. Ohh. Oh, wow! - No? - No.

 Oh, no, it's good. It's good. Keep going. Mmm. Mmm. I have

 another room that I would love to show you. Really? Uh-huh. You're

 getting... better at this. Mmm. Ow. Oh! Hang on. Hang on. Shoot!

 Oh. Right here? Okay. No, I... dropped something. Oh. Can I help?

 My ring fell off. You had to have shag carpeting, huh? Ugh.

 That gay guy at my office said shag was back. Really need

 to start getting my style tips from someone else. Damn it. Where

 is it? This rug... it swallows everything. There used to be an

 end table here and... Oh, my God! Please don't be funny right

 now. Wait. Wait. Wait. Here it is. Oh. Thank you. So, uh,

 where were we? I'm sorry. I can't. You're a really great guy.

 You're nice and you're funny and... Whatever you were doing... To... to

 my neck was really working for me, but the idea of walking

 10 feet into your bedroom is about the scariest thing I can

 think of right now. Okay. I'm... Hoping to work things out with

 my husband, and I guess I just... I get it. You're not

 there yet. I'm not. Well, I think I should go. Come on.

 Bye. I understand your hesitation. I am one of those people with

 a manicured lawn who would object when a proposal like this threatens

 her community. But my eyes have been opened, and I will personally

 go door-to-door to help other people see how essential this project is,

 so that where we live can truly be called a community. You

 were amazing. Well, I meant every word. I want to help you

 any way I can. Great. Well, uh, first thing tomorrow, I'll take

 you out to see the construction site. Yes, we may think we're

 all destined to play certain roles. But sometimes those roles can unexpectedly

 change. A nervous student may discover a hidden confidence. A longtime wife

 may confront a harsh new reality. A busy mother may find her

 attention is needed elsewhere. And a woman who wanted to do a

 little bit of good may find herself playing a much bigger role

 than she intended. I was searching and searching for the perfect spot,

 and then I found it... Chapman woods. Have you ever been here

 before? Once. Well, they're finally gonna break ground on Tuesday, and it's

 all thanks to you. Glad I could help. www.SUBTITULOS.es -DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-"}
