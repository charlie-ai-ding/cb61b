 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: Your spleen wandered close to your heart. - Get

 your insurance figured out. - There was the bad news... There's a

 cop I want you to talk to. Sullivan. - The file on

 Noah's daughter. ...the discomforting news... Thanks. Are you hiding someone in your

 house? - Tell me your secrets. I'll understand. - OK. ...and the

 news no one should know. But you tell me yours first. Once

 a month, the creme de la creme of Fairview society would attend

 a semi-formal luncheon at the home of Maxine Bennett. Everyone loved these

 elegant get-togethers. Everyone, that is, but a certain redheaded housewife, who was

 convinced Maxine was a liar. You see, Maxine liked to brag that

 she did all her own cooking. And because each course was served

 promptly, - presented with flair... - It smells delicious. ...and was positively

 mouth-watering, Bree knew Maxine had had some help. - Thank you so

 much. - And sadly for Maxine, Bree intended to prove it. Once

 again this entire lunch was just out of this world. I just

 have to get the number of your caterer. What a nice compliment.

 No, I'm afraid this was all my doing. It was an absolute

 triumph. Come on. Do you honestly expect us to believe that you

 had the time to prepare a six-course meal for ten women? Even

 I couldn't make this and have time to get ready for a

 party. Well, perhaps you're just not as organised as I am. If

 you'll excuse me... Bree, what's gotten into you? I have the same

 recipe for English plum pudding. It takes six hours to prepare. How

 would she have time to make all this and everything else we

 ate today? This is not the pudding of an honest woman. FBI.

 Open up! What on earth? - We're looking for Maxine Bennett. -

 I'm Maxine. We have a warrant to search the premises. A warrant?

 I'm in the middle of a luncheon. Over here. Found her. What?

 Maxine Bennett, you're under arrest for involuntary servitude. - Is this the

 woman who locked you up? - Yeah. Bree, what's going on? Well,

 I'm not sure, but I think Maxine had a slave. I can't

 believe it. I just can't believe it. But Bree could. You see,

 for her, the proof was in the pudding. Checkmate! The world is

 filled with unlikely friendships. Odd pairings that, to the casual observer... ...make

 absolutely no sense at all. But if we look closer, we can

 see why these alliances form. After all, a shared purpose can give

 even mortal enemies common ground. - Bree? We have a question for

 you. - Oh, what is it? We were just wondering... We were

 curious about... What the hell's going on with you and Betty Applewhite?

 Excuse me? When the dead body showed up, nobody was yelling, \"The

 Applewhites are involved!\" Louder than you. The next thing, you're having Betty

 over for poker? - What gives? - She makes us sound angry.

 - We're not angry. - I am. Can we talk about this

 later? I have ice cream in here. Could this flip-flop have something

 to do with the fact that Danielle's dating Matthew? I knew that

 would get her. Who told you that? Mrs McCluskey saw them making

 out in the park. - Edie! - What? - Can't you sugar-coat

 it a little? - I did. He had his hand down her

 shirt. Bree, we know you have a reason for wanting Betty to

 hang out with us. We just wondered if you could clue us

 in a little. When it comes to Betty Applewhite, I know what

 I'm doing. You two are gonna have to trust me. And if

 you can't do that, then I've overestimated the depth of our friendship.

 Now, if you'll excuse me... What a bitch. - Edie, can you?

 - I was sugar-coating it. Hey. None of that in here. Maybe

 if we remind Ed that I'm shacking up with the senior VP,

 - he'll stop killing my pitches. - It's been a week. -

 Give yourself a break. - Honey, you know the ad game. I

 got a short time to make my mark before he kicks me

 to the kerb. Look, I'm just asking you, jump in every once

 in a while, throw me some rope when Ed's on the warpath.

 I can't protect you. You'll have to find a way to click

 with Ed yourself. Then the pig, he rubs his stomach, and he

 goes: \"Farm Fresh bacon will make a piggy out of you too!\"

 So... the pig actually eats the bacon? - Yeah. - I don't

 see the client doing a happy dance over the whole cannibalism theme.

 Why don't you pitch them the other idea you came up with

 last night? Where people love bacon so much they want to keep

 it a secret. What? Like a secret underground society of bacon eaters?

 Like my college fraternity, everybody wanted in, but we only took the

 coolest guys. - You were Greek? - Yeah, Alpha Tau Omega. -

 I was Phi Kapp. - You? I don't remember you having to

 be that cool to pledge ATO. If I had a nickel for

 every Phi Kapp that I tied naked to a freeway sign... If

 you were my pledge, - I'd have made you my bitch. -

 You think so? You know what? I'm liking this whole fraternity angle.

 Let's talk about it over lunch. You're buying. Go! - Thanks for

 your help. - My pleasure. Hello. What's going on? Gabrielle, I want

 you to meet someone. This is Xiao Mei. The young lady who

 was forced to work for Maxine. Oh, the slave. Wow. Looks well-fed.

 The church is arranging for her return to China, but until then

 she needs a place to stay. So I offered up our guest

 room. Really? Baby, can I talk to you for a second? -

 Are you nuts? - It's only for a couple of days! This

 time! You are quickly becoming Father Crowley's go-to guy for charity cases!

 And that's a bad thing? When he turns our house into a

 Catholic Underground Railroad, yes! You know who you are? The kind of

 person who'd have turned away Mary and Joseph. Well, they should have

 called ahead! Don't brush your hair at the table. You're talking to

 me? Does this mean you've forgiven me? Why should I? You betrayed

 this family, and you're not even sorry. - Don't be such a

 drama queen. - If the Applewhites go to the police and tell

 them your brother ran over Mrs Solis, he could go to prison!

 - How can you not understand that? - They won't, as long

 as you - don't go to the police about Caleb. - What

 did this Caleb do, exactly? And why on earth are they hiding

 him? Go to Mrs Applewhite and tell her you need to know

 what's going on. I bet if you were really nice, she'd tell

 you the truth. Is that what you really think, Danielle? I should

 go to Mrs Applewhite, be nice, and then she'll hand over all

 her secrets? Yeah. When I was young, my stepmother told me that

 I was very lucky. I possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight. These

 were weapons all women needed to survive in the world. So? So

 take good care of your looks, Danielle. You don't have any other

 weapons at your disposal. Hi. I need an operation on my spleen.

 I just found out I don't have insurance. Is there anyone I

 can sue? After the embezzlement, Lonny let the policy lapse. And now

 he's in jail, and I'm gonna die! You won't die. I'll get

 into it with the insurance company. There isn't time to deal with

 red tape! My spleen is going careening into my heart. I need

 that operation now. I'd loan you the money myself, but Edie and

 I just plopped down our savings in a ski condo. I don't

 need a loan. I need coverage. I mean, what if there are

 complications? I don't have a safety net! Please. - What in the

 hell are you doing? - I'm saying a little prayer. For puke's

 sake. What? I'm desperate here. Do you have any other ideas? As

 a matter of fact, I do. - What you need is a

 husband. - What? The only way to get a good health plan

 is to marry into one. - Edie, come on. - No, no,

 I think she's onto something. Yeah. If we find a guy with

 the right plan, you could have a sham wedding on a Monday

 night - and be covered Tuesday morning. - I can't believe you're

 considering it. The surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow.

 What other choice do I have? All we have to do is

 find a guy who's willing to marry you. You know, come to

 think of it, a little prayer might not be such a bad

 idea, after all. Pat, we're all here, so send the call in

 as soon as you get it. Two hundred bucks says you can't

 do that three times in a row. You catch three of those,

 200 bucks. - What do you say, there, Scavo? - You're on.

 Here we go. Thrown by me. I thought we were here to

 talk about the Farm Fresh rollout? They gotta be catchable, big guy.

 Let me worry about the shooting. Come on. - That's one. -

 Guys... Nice moves. - One more, big guy. - Guys, please... All

 right. That wasn't even catchable! Maybe not, but it was totally worth

 the 200 bucks. Well, you got me. You're a regular little monkey

 man. I love this guy. Oh, hi. Do you have to sit

 around all day? Shouldn't you experience Western civilisation while you have the

 chance? What are you doing? - I fix. - No, this is

 couture! This rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor. You

 can't just... Holy crap! This stitching is perfect. Hungry? Did you make

 all of this? For me? OK. - Oh, my God. - You

 like? I like a lot. You like that? Yeah, it's nice. You

 know what they do to people in China who speak out against

 the government? They put them in forced labour camps. Isn't that awful?

 No, I mean, it's such a repressive regime. We forget how good

 we have it. Yes, we do. Don't you think Xiao Mei would

 like it better here, in America? I mean, where she could learn

 about freedom and democracy and stuff. Does this have anything to do

 with you making Xiao Mei do housework? - What? - I found

 her waxing the floor. She told me you asked her to put

 on two coats. Well, first of all, that was her idea. Second,

 I can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs. She

 just got done being a slave. She wants to go back to

 China. We can't force her to stay here and be our maid.

 Who's forcing her? We'll pay whatever she wants. And the best part

 is, with her r?sum?, any wage will look good. No way, baby.

 What? What? What, so you don't get what you want, you walk

 off and pout? This isn't about me. This is about our great

 nation. I have no intention of satisfying a man who isn't willing

 to stand up for and help spread the ideals and values of

 the United States of America. Sometimes she is a little hard to

 stomach, but she means well. - There she is! - Hi! I

 came as soon as I got your message. Is this? This is

 Gary Grantham, your future ex-husband. - Wow. Nice to meet you. -

 Hi. I've gotta meet a client. I've gotta go. So just talk

 amongst yourselves, and you two make a very handsome couple. Yeah. Yeah.

 - Hi. - Hi. So do you wanna get married on Wednesday?

 Cos Thursday and Friday, I'm out of town. Oh, yeah, sure. Wednesday's

 great. I'm just curious. How did Edie convince you to do this

 so quickly? She explained your situation. I'm in need of a fake

 bride. - So I figured, \"What the heck?\" - Why would you

 need a fake bride? I'm gay. And I've never come out to

 my mother. - Really? - Yeah. At first I just didn't want

 to upset her. She got older, got emphysema and diverticulitis. I started

 thinking if I just kept my mouth shut, one day nature would

 take its course, and we could avoid what was sure to be

 a very ugly scene. So, what changed? She told me at her

 81 st birthday party last month, the only reason she's hanging on

 is to see me get married. So by marrying me... Yeah, I

 get my inheritance that much sooner. But mostly I want to make

 sure she's happy. Well, you seem very nice, Susan. It will be

 a pleasure being married to you. Likewise. You can finish the rest

 of the fries. Here's your mail and your pills. More pills. Miss

 Tillman? Where did this come from? I don't know. It was in

 with your other mail. Get me the phone. Sullivan, it's me. I

 just got some news, and I need to get you involved. Looks

 like Delfino's been holding out on me. The next morning, Bree came

 up with a plan to get to the truth she so desperately

 needed. As she watched the Applewhites leave their house, she thought of

 how much she had trusted the previous owners. And how much they

 had trusted her. Caleb, is that you? Hi. I'm Bree. I live

 down the street. I'm a friend of your mother's. - She's not

 home. - I know. - I came to see you. - Me?

 Yes. Your mother told me all about you. And I thought it

 might be nice if we had a little visit. I brought you

 some homemade cobbler. Right here. Follow the doughnut, people. Here we go.

 We got the people. Come on. - What's going on? - Well...

 ...Ed bet Tom that he wouldn't eat a doughnut out of the

 toilet! - I can't believe it. - Isn't it disgusting? No, it's

 gotta be fully dunked. I don't want the glaze to repel the

 water. Slight delay. I'm requesting a scrub-down. Does anybody know where they

 keep the toilet brush? One second. I never thought I'd have to

 ask you this, but are you eating a doughnut from the toilet?

 Yeah. For the Galveston Jewellers account. I don't care. You're not gonna

 do this. You told me to find a way to click with

 Ed. Well, now we've got our thing. And it's paying off for

 me. Because Ed gets off on humiliating you. Please, don't do this.

 We're waiting, Scavo. This is my moment. So, Caleb, besides your mother

 and brother, does anybody else know that you're here? No. You're pretty.

 Thank you. That's very sweet. So where have you been living this

 whole time, upstairs? No. I just moved upstairs. - My room's downstairs.

 - Downstairs? In the basement. You want to see it? Caleb, have

 you been down here all these months? Yeah. Did your mother make

 you wear those? Most of the time. Oh, my God. Sweetheart, I

 don't understand. Why in the world would your mother treat you that

 way? - I hurt a girl. - A girl? Yeah. And then

 she died. Her name was Melanie. She was pretty. Just like you.

 Hi. I thought you should know I'm getting married. - To the

 doctor? - No! No. No, to a gay guy. - How did

 you know about the doctor? - People talk. - You're marrying a

 gay guy? - I need health insurance because I've got this wandering

 spleen, and... that sounds funny. \"Spleen, wandering,\" but actually, it's not funny,

 because it can bang into things. I need health insurance, so I'm

 getting married tomorrow. You probably think I'm crazy, right? Well, can it

 wait? The surgery? No. It can't wait. Guess it's really not that

 crazy. How're you doing, ma'am? - Could you just give me a

 minute? - Oh, yeah. No, I'm sorry. That was really it. -

 What do you want? - It's not what I want, Delfino. It's

 what Noah Taylor wants. Where's his grandkid? Let's skip the part where

 you don't know anything about anything. Mr Taylor wants to chat. What

 if I say no? Then I've got to find the kid myself.

 My guess is he or she is somewhere around here close. Your

 old girlfriend, she's got a daughter, right? Maybe I should start by

 paying her a visit. - Her daughter's not the one. - Yeah,

 well, given your track record, I might want to check that out

 for myself. Tell him I'll be there in the morning. Oh, so

 pretty. You like nice things? That's why I think you're stupid for

 not wanting to stay here. You could be around my nice things

 all the time, taking care of them. How fun would that be?

 Well, I'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in

 that tiny godforsaken village of yours. You know, we're probably more alike

 than people would guess. I'm from a small town too. My folks

 had nothing. That's why I love America. Anything is possible. You like

 that? Well, an old, fat stockbroker gave this to me. It's not

 worth anything. You can have it. OK. Glad you like it. You

 can brush my hair. - Hi. - Hi. It's the best I

 could do on such short notice. - OK. - OK. Oh, Susan,

 this is my best man, Steven. He's also my life partner. Oh,

 hi. It's nice to meet you. Baby, be... be nice. - I'm

 sorry you have cancer. - Cancer? Isn't that the point of this

 whole charade? Gary said you needed insurance. Yes. No. I do need

 insurance, I just don't have cancer. I have a wandering spleen. I

 said it was like cancer. Is there a problem? No. Everything's fine.

 Let's just go to the chapel, shall we? I made a wedding

 cake. I hope you enjoy it. So... are we ready to get

 started? Do you have a thing to play music? I had Steven

 burn a little wedding mix for us, - for ambiance. - Sure.

 Just give me a sec. Do you have a problem? You said

 she was sick! She is. She has a wandering spleen. It sounds

 nothing like cancer. It doesn't even sound real. - Well, it is.

 I could die. - You look fine to me, honey. Don't do

 this. I have asked you six times to fly with me to

 Holland and get married, and you always have some lame excuse. But

 the second some chick with a silly disease comes along, you drop

 everything and head for a chapel. No, it's a serious illness. It

 sounds silly because of the word \"spleen.\" - What do you want?

 - Worry about my feelings half as much as you worry about

 your mother's. What will make you happy? Not have the wedding? -

 Is that what you're asking? - No, stop right there. I would

 love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in Holland more

 than anyone. The tulips, the clogs, in front of a windmill, the

 whole shebang. But unless I get this surgery, my spleen is going

 to slam straight into my heart and explode. Seeing as how I'm

 just a nice person and I always support gay rights, let's just

 do this. Then I'll have a husband and insurance, and nobody gets

 hurt. Come on. Steven... Steven! - He's just... - Yeah. I'm so

 sorry. My hands are tied. I'm really sorry. Steven, wait! Steven! Where

 are you going? What are you doing? I finally got the sound

 system working. Where's the groom? Hey, Susie Q. What's wrong? For a

 newlywed, you don't have much spring in your step. - I didn't

 get married. - Really? I got to the altar, but the whole

 fake wedding thing sort of imploded. Wow. I'm sorry. I still don't

 have insurance. I need to get that operation. I'm... I'm really screwed.

 Well... ...why don't I just marry you? - What? I've got a

 fantastic health plan. You'd be covered instantly. No... we were actually married.

 Look, I've always felt awful about walking out on you the way

 I did. And I figure if we do this, I'd basically be

 saving your life. I figure I owe you one. Karl... So, what

 do you say? Will you marry me, Susan Mayer? Again? What the

 hell. Cool. - What about Edie? - We can't tell her. -

 She'd kill us both. - It'd be our little secret. We've really

 enjoyed having you as a guest. Right? Absolutely. Xiao Mei, you are

 a very special girl. So... so you take care, OK? - Thanks

 for all your help, Carlos. - My pleasure, Father. - Bye-bye. -

 Ladies... Don't tell me you're crying, because you can't have the maid

 you want. Carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid. She would

 have been the best damn maid ever. - God, you're pathetic. -

 Shut up. Hey. Something's going on. Father Crowley! Is there a problem?

 Xiao Mei doesn't want to go back to China. She wants to

 stay here and work for you. What? Why? She says Mrs Solis

 treated her with more kindness than she's ever known. She now thinks

 of you two as family. Oh, really? Oh, of course, you can

 stay! Gabby... Carlos, she thinks of us as family. I'm ready for

 those Farm Fresh concepts. Conference room in five... ...toilet boy! - You're

 not allowed to complain. - You were right. I'm known throughout the

 advertising world as \"toilet boy.\" Tell him you're done with games. You

 don't want to play anymore. I can't. If I back down now

 he'll see it as a sign of weakness. This is the way

 that guys do business. - But... - So he called it. He

 made me his bitch. Come on. Here you go. I've been thinking,

 we've had a lot of fun around here lately, but maybe it's

 time to set a slightly more professional tone in the office. Oh,

 I get it. - Somebody went running to mommy? - What? Tom

 loses a few bets, so he tries to get his wife to

 make me back off? Oh, this is so Alpha Tau. I am

 gonna make him pay. No. No, you're not gonna make him pay.

 You're gonna stop this now. This is my company. If people want

 to work here, they play by my rules. Ed! What? I'm calling

 you out. Yes, this is your company, so I'll play by your

 rules. What do I have to do to get you to stop

 this frat boy crap? Shave my eyebrows? Come to work naked? Name

 your stakes. - I don't have time for this. - What's wrong,

 Ed? Afraid a Phi Kapp's gonna be beat by a girl? Come

 on, big man. It's just a little bet. As you know, I

 think that making the workplace fun is good for morale. But Lynette

 here thinks that our shenanigans have gotten a little out of hand.

 Hold on, hold on. I respect Lynette's work ethic. So we've decided

 to settle the matter with a little test of intestinal fortitude. If

 she can eat one pound of our client's fine Farm Fresh pork

 product raw... ...there will be a moratorium on wagering in the office.

 You're doing this for me. You don't need to. - I don't

 need you fighting my fights. - I am not. This is my

 fight. This is how guys do business, right? I gotta see this.

 This is so disgusting. We're counting on you. While we're young. Go,

 girl. No shame in defeat, Lynette. No shame at all. Go, girl.

 I cannot believe that. This is too much. What? She took the

 bet! This is fun, people! She has one more. - Too much.

 - Did she do it? So... ...can this be a place of

 business again, Ed? No more games? Sure. You sucked all the fun

 out of it, anyway. - Gotta get back to work. - Let's

 get out of here. That was really something. Thanks. Could you scrounge

 me up a bucket? Caleb said a nice red-haired lady came to

 visit him. Come on in, Betty. Get you a drink? This is

 not a social call. Did you or did you not break into

 my home and talk to my son? Caleb and I had a

 very lovely chat, yes. If you come near him again, there will

 be hell to pay. Do you understand? Aren't you gonna ask me

 what we talked about? The name... Melanie Foster came up. I'm gonna

 pour you a drink now, Betty, because we're about to have a

 very honest discussion, and I think you're gonna need a little help

 getting through it. His name is Zach Young. He lives with his

 father. Mother committed suicide about a year ago. How did he end

 up with these people? How do you think? Deirdre was strung out.

 She gave him up. I want to see this boy. He has

 a family. I can't snap my fingers and get him here. But

 I can snap my fingers, and Detective Sullivan can make it happen.

 - You don't want to. - No? Is that how you wanna

 meet him? Have that thug drag him here so Grandpa can give

 him a hug? Fine, you bring him. I'll give you two days.

 As you know, I'm on a bit of a clock here. When

 Caleb was born, and the doctors discovered that he was different, I

 didn't even cry. It was the most painful moment of my life.

 I didn't shed a single tear. I just thought to myself, \"What's

 the point? He is my son, and I have to raise him

 as best I can. Now, that's my job.\" In a lot of

 ways, I feel so blessed. Caleb is challenged, but he has such

 a sweet nature. I'm sure you noticed that when you came to

 visit. Yes, I did. I also noticed that you had him chained

 in the basement. That's because of Melanie Foster. Melanie was a girl

 that Matthew dated. She was a debutante. And like typical teenagers, their

 relationship was full of drama. They were always breaking up, getting back

 together, breaking up. One night, after one of their big blowups, Caleb

 somehow convinced Melanie to meet him down at our local lumberyard. I

 can only imagine that she thought he was bringing some kind of

 apology from Matthew. But he wasn't. Caleb told Melanie he was in

 love with her and that if he was her boyfriend, he would

 never break up with her. And she laughed in his face. He

 tried to show her he was serious by kissing her. And she

 hit him. He doesn't remember a lot after that. But he does

 know that he got very, very angry and... And that there was

 an axe lying on the ground nearby him. Yes, my Caleb killed

 Melanie. But I couldn't let him go to jail. Or worse, be

 put down, for what was really my crime. Your crime? It was

 my responsibility. I was supposed to protect him from himself. I am

 his mother. That was my job. The world is filled with unlikely

 friendships. How do they begin? With one person desperately in need and

 another willing to lend a helping hand. When such kindness is offered,

 we're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously

 written off. And before we know it, a bond has formed, regardless

 of whether others can understand it. Yes, unlikely friendships start up every

 day. No one understands this more than the lonely. In fact, it's
