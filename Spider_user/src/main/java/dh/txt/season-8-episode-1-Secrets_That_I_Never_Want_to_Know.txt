 on... I wanna get things right this time. Bree's relationship with detective

 Vance got serious. What are we gonna say to people? Tom and

 Lynette decided to separate. We shouldn't tell anyone until we tell the

 kids. Oh, god. The kids. Sit down. Ow! Gaby's stepfather returned to

 terrorize her again... I remember those nights in your room, baby. No!

 Stop. Until Carlos stopped him... permanently. Gaby? What happened? - I killed

 him. - And now he's gonna go to jail because he was

 trying to protect me. Calm down. We just need time to think.

 We don't have time. Yes, there was the dinner party. Everybody's coming.

 Including your boyfriend the detective. I killed the son of a bitch

 who hurt my wife. If I have to go to prison, I

 will. That's not gonna happen. Every hostess knows there's work to be

 done after the guests leave a party. And only the best of

 friends will stay long after the party's over... to help clean up

 the mess. They help with the heavy lifting... they work together to

 lighten the load. They take on the most unpleasant tasks. And, of

 course, there's no task more unpleasant than getting rid of an unwanted

 guest. I should go move the car off the trail. You gonna

 be okay? Is this happening? Are we really doing this? Everyone stay

 focused. The hardest part is over. Now all we have to do

 is fill this in. Oh, my god. I thought I got everything.

 No. No, you missed the phone. And if you missed that, what

 else did you miss? Susan, it's gonna be okay. How is it

 going to be okay? Someone is calling the dead guy. - \"Home.\"

 - See? He has a home... with people who care about him,

 people who are going to come looking for him, leading them straight

 to us. What do you want us to do? It's not too

 late. We... we could still go to the police. And send my

 husband back to prison? This time for murder? No, not necessarily. It

 was self-defense. He broke into your house. He threatened you. We could

 explain that. Yeah, then we can explain how we dumped him in

 a trunk, ate some cheesecake, and buried him in the woods! We

 are going to get caught. People always get caught. We can't do

 this. We're not criminals. We drive carpool. That's enough. This is a

 very bad man. He attacked our friend, and her husband protected her,

 and now we are gonna protect them. That means we tell no

 one. Not the police... not our families. No one. When we bury

 the body, we bury the secret forever. Susan? Yes, it's only the

 best of friends who stay long after the party's over to help

 clean up the mess... Even when that mess may be bigger than

 they bargained for. It has been said that change doesn't happen overnight,

 but over the course of month, it's amazing how much the ground

 can shift beneath us. A woman who helped conceal a crime is

 now sleeping with a detective. A man who used to look forward

 to bedtime... is now finding himself dreading it. A woman who once

 told her husband everything is now keeping a terrible secret. And a

 couple who have decided to separate is now going to great lengths

 to show that nothing has changed. Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Aah! Son

 of a... Hey, hey, hey, guys! Got up early, so I figured,

 what the heck? I'll go get your mom some coffee... the good

 stuff. She deserves it. She needs it, too. I didn't sleep last

 night. But you would know that. You were there. Do not drink

 this. It's been in my car for three days. Where are your

 shoes, dad? It's casual friday. Casual thursday. Come on. We're gonna miss

 the bus. See ya later. I'll see ya at dinner. Love you.

 God, I practically lost a toe out there. It wouldn't have happened

 if you hadn't overslept. Yeah, well, you know, you took the good

 alarm clock along with the good pillow and the house. This is

 ridiculous. We have to tell the kids we've separated. We will, but

 this weekend is Gaby's big barbecue, and I don't wanna ruin it

 for them. Yeah, and last weekend, you didn't wanna ruin the basketball

 tournament. The weekend before that, Penny's birthday. Come on, Lynette. Are you

 sure this is about the kids? What else would it be? No,

 Tom, nothing's changed. We still need time away from each other. Yeah,

 I agree. We got a lot of problems to work out, so

 why can't we tell the kids? I just think they deserve one

 more happy weekend before we tear this family apart. You know what?

 You're... Paige is up. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Don't take this the wrong

 way, but you could do this professionally. Coming from a man who's

 on a first-name basis with half the hookers in Fairview, that's quite

 a compliment, detective. Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend, we could

 head up to that place in the mountains, just the two of

 us. Oh, that sounds lovely, but Gaby is having her annual barbecue

 on saturday. Am I invited? Of course you are. Why wouldn't you

 be? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because your friends don't like me.

 What? You are imagining things. It's true. They don't talk to me.

 They don't make eye contact. It's been that way for weeks, ever

 since the night of the dinner party. Why... Uh, why would you

 say that? Bree, I'm a cop. I got an eye for human

 behavior. That was when everything changed. I just can't figure out why.

 I keep going over that night, hour by hour. Well, stop... going

 over that night, because everything is fine. The girls are just as

 crazy about you as I am. I don't know. I'm not feeling

 it. Well... Are you feeling this? Bree, I know what's going on.

 You're trying to distract me with sex, and if that's the case...

 Mmm. Bring it on. Wake up! I made you waffles. Come back

 when you learn how to make mimosas. Come on! I left Celia

 alone with them. There won't be any left. Damn it, Juanita! That's

 enough! Get outta here now! Carlos! Juanita, honey, I'm sorry! Why have

 you been so short-tempered lately? Gosh, I don't know. Maybe I'm upset

 about my golf swing or the economy... or maybe it's because I

 killed a guy. Look, I get it, okay? But we have to

 move on with our lives. Don't you think I want to? I

 just can't stop thinking about this. No matter what I do, it's

 this horrible thing that is always there. I need to talk to

 someone. I know a guy named Tom Collins. He's a great listener.

 I meant father Dugan. Okay, are you crazy? You can't tell anyone.

 That's too risky. A priest can't share what you say in confession.

 Are you sure he's not just gonna make you feel guiltier? I

 mean, that's their thing. Fine. We'll go see the priest. I have

 to. I'm turning into a terrible husband, father. I need to get

 this off my conscience. It's tearing me apart. Susan. What are you

 doing? Oh. I was looking out the window, and I noticed dust

 in the corner of each windowpane. It's been driving me nuts. Okay.

 What's going on with you? What do you mean? Well, there's a

 lot of weird stuff you like to do in the bedroom, but

 cleaning... not so much. Couldn't sleep. Yeah, that's been happening a lot

 lately. You don't sleep. You don't eat. You never leave the house.

 That's not true. I'm substitute teaching today. And that's great, but... Did

 you have a fight with the girls? What? Why would you say

 that? Well, a month ago, you were so excited to move back

 to the lane, and now you never see 'em. There's... no coffee,

 no poker, no... bitching about husbands over coffee and poker. The girls

 and I are fine. Then what is it? Come on, Susan. It's

 me. You can tell me anything. I'm going for a run. Susan.

 Well, you said I should get out of the house more. Hey.

 So what do we know about the new guy? Definitely rich. Check

 out the car. Definitely single. Check out the fish. Rich and single...

 I wonder what he looks like. You rarely get the trifecta. What's

 your guess? Wonky eye? Rabbit teeth? Comb-over? One normal eyebrow, one really

 big one? Baby hands? I had it all on one guy. Did

 not end well. Well, I actually saw our new neighbor this morning.

 Hmm. 6'1\". 190. He was wearing this great-looking pair of jeans. And

 let me just say, I can tell you one thing that isn't

 wonky. Gaby. Oh, come on. I'm married. I'm not dead. Can still

 imagine all the dirty things I'd do to him. - Like what?

 - Oh, god! Oh! I didn't know you were... I'm Susan Delfino.

 Ah. Nice to meet you. Ben Faulkner. Hi. Well, I'm actually 6'2\",

 and I haven't been 190 since I played rugby, but, uh, thank

 you. Uh, and as for the jeans, you know, I could never

 figure out why they would cost 200 bucks. Now I know. Ladies,

 excuse me. - Oh. Okay. - Thanks. Welcome. Dibs. Look who's out.

 Hey, Susan! Uh, would you like to join us for coffee?! Uh,

 sorry. I can't talk. I'm subbing today! Can't be late! Is anyone

 talking to her? I tried. She's not returning my calls. Same here.

 She's obviously avoiding us. I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.

 Well, we have got to get her back in the fold. This

 is too risky. Says the woman who's dating a cop. Did it

 ever occur to you that it might be good to keep him

 close? If there's ever an investigation, I will be the first to

 know. I'm doing this for us. He's that good in the sack?

 You have no idea. And when you finish your worksheets on ladybugs,

 we will go outside and see if we can find some. Susan,

 how's it going? Good. It's nice to be back. To be honest,

 I've been feeling a little down lately. This is just what I

 needed. Mrs. Delfino? Cupcake's not moving. She's probably sleeping, honey. No, I

 poked her with my pencil a couple times. She is d-e-a dead.

 Uh... it's okay, kids. I know what to do. Oh, my god.

 What do I do? There's a little spot in the garden where

 we bury the class pets. - Bury? - Yeah. Have a little

 funeral. Say a few words. Just don't mention god. Amanda's parents are

 atheists, lawyers, and major douches. Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

 It's been a while since my last confession. Continue, my son. \"My

 son.\" I'm sorry. It's just you're, like, a thousand years older than

 me. Who are you and where's father Dugan? Leaving on sabbatical. Fun

 for him and fun for me. This is my first week of

 confessions. It is? Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard. There was

 a lady yesterday who... No, no, no, I can't say it. I

 think I'll come back. Unh-unh. No. You're not going anywhere. I told

 you to wait in the car. Don't snap at me. That's why

 we're here. You keep saying you wanna talk to someone, so talk

 to this guy. He seems perfectly... enthusiastic. He's 12 years old. This

 will blow his collar off. Oh, man, this must be awesome. I'm

 so bummed I can't tweet anymore. Sorry. If it's not father Dugan,

 I'm not doing this. No... let's go. Nuts. I was really hoping

 this would be a good one. I made out with two chicks

 once in college. This job rocks! Uh... I don't know if you've

 ever buried anything before, but you have to dig a hole. Right.

 Of course. I knew that. It's funny the way life works out

 sometimes, isn't it? I mean, I wasn't even supposed to be here

 today. Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now

 I have to carry this around with me for the rest of

 my life. Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino. Cupcake was kind of a

 bad hamster. She had three babies and ate them. But does that

 mean she deserved to die? We don't get to make that call,

 Juanita. We're not god. That's right, Amanda. I said it. What have

 I done? It's not your fault. I know it's not my fault,

 but try telling that to Cupcake's family when they show up looking

 for her. There. We're done. Now let's all slap on a happy

 face and pretend like this never happened. Can I come in? I'm

 really not feeling like drinking right now. Great. Mmm. So... were you

 two close? Pardon? You and Cupcake. Juanita told me what happened. I

 assume you two had a long history, went to college together, backpacked

 through Europe. It just sort of hit me in a weird way.

 I'm worried about you. First, you stop talking to your friends. Now

 you're wigging out at a rat funeral. You're making me nervous. Well,

 I'm sorry I'm not handling accessory to murder as well as the

 rest of you. Susan, I'm begging you. This is my husband's life

 we're talking about. If anything were to happen to him, think of

 what would happen to me and my girls. I know you're having

 a hard time, but please hold it together. I'm trying. Try harder.

 Bree? Do I smell... Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut... your favorite. Oh!

 Now you're my favorite. Mwah. Hmm. How was your day? Terrific. I

 found a dead body. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. You don't wanna hear about

 this. No, I do. Your work is fascinating. So, um, where exactly

 did you find this body? Warehouse out by the docks. So now

 I'm a big hero because I cracked a case those poor bastards

 in New haven P.D. have been working on for months. Oh, good

 for you. Mm. I got lucky. All I did was spot a

 sedan with Connecticut plates, and I asked myself, \"Who owns that car?\"

 The dead man had a car. Exactly. The killers did everything right,

 but they forgot to get rid of the victim's ride. What idiots.

 Mm-hmm. So you kept his keys, but it never occurred to you

 he might have a car. I just threw all his stuff in

 our safe. I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it.

 There it is. Drop it off in a bad part of town,

 and let social decay... take its course. Oh, god, do you have

 to tidy up? Get in. If anybody catches us in this car,

 we're dead. Oh, no, it's a stick. I can't drive a stick.

 Can you? I did once in high school. It's easy. Just one

 extra pedal. Oh. It was easier when I was drunk. What should

 I do? Should I gun it? Gun it? You can't even drive

 it. I thought that was you. - Chuck. Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.

 - Mm. I-I saw you were struggling. Whose car is this? -

 My aunt's. - My friend's. Her aunt and my friend. Aunt Shirley.

 She, uh, came over to my place last night for book club,

 and... She had too much to drink. Classic Shirley. So we told

 her we'd bring her car back today. - In fact, she's waiting

 for us, so we should scoot. - Yeah. No way. - I'll

 drive. - What? The way you guys are going, you're gonna kill

 someone. Go, Bob. I'll meet you back at the station. Oh, no,

 Bob, Bob, don't go! Bob? Oh. Well... Okay, a road trip in

 this neat old car with your cop boyfriend. Fun. So where does

 Shirley live? Yeah, Bree, where does she live? Why are you asking

 me? She's your aunt. Just keep driving. I'll tell you when to

 turn. Huh. That's interesting. No, it's not. I mean... what is? Oklahoma

 city redhawks. Is your aunt a fan? Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that...

 uh... sport. And... men's cologne? She's a lesbian. Yeah. She could've been

 married, but, no, she's a lesbian. So, this, um, aunt or... friend,

 who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian... she also likes to chew tobacco? 'Cause

 I never met a woman who likes to chew... ever. I chew

 tobacco. And I'm a woman. Yeah. Mmm. All that's missing is a

 glass of chardonnay. I keep telling her to quit. \"Do you want

 mouth cancer?\" I say, but she won't listen. You okay? Yeah. Ugh!

 No. Pull over. Now. Sorry! Shirley likes plain. I prefer chocolate. Oh!

 Get out. What? I'm taking your car. Oh, my god. I could

 kiss you! What? What are you... Just get out! Shh! Keep your

 voice down. That man over there is a cop. A cop? No!

 Get back in here. When you start something, young man, you see

 it through. Buckle up! Hey, what happened? Shirley. Just happened to be

 walking by. Isn't that a stroke of luck? So do you think

 your friend Bob could give us a ride home? Sure. I'll... I'll

 call him. So how's that dating a cop while covering up a

 murder working out for you? Hey, Renee. Ladies. Don't distract them. They

 have an important job to do. I'm gonna go see the new

 neighbor. You know, give him a ride on the ol' welcome wagon.

 Wow, that was fast. - I didn't know you two had even

 talked. - We haven't. So what makes you think he's gonna be

 interested? Hear that, ladies? Watch and learn. I will show you some

 of my secrets. Hi. I'm gonna save us some time. Look, I'm

 single. You're single. I'm hot. You're hot. Assuming you're not gay, and

 those shoes tell me you're not, we could do that thing where

 we flirt for a few weeks. You can stare at my ass

 getting the mail, and I do get my mail four times a

 day. Or you... could invite me in for... coffee... Right now. Thanks

 for the offer, but, uh, I'm good. Um, when I said \"coffee,\"

 you did know I meant sex, right? Oh, you were subtle, but,

 uh, yeah. I got it. Wow. You should write a book. Otherwise,

 when you die, your secrets will die with you. Father Dugan! I'm

 so glad I caught you. I don't know if you remember me.

 Gabrielle Solis. I assume you've come to apologize for taking a phone

 call during my easter sermon? Oh! I'm sorry, father. But, you know,

 if you don't confirm those spa appointments, you lose 'em. Yeah. Um,

 anyway, I came here about Carlos. He's in trouble, and he needs

 your help. Well, I'd love to help Carlos. He's a good man.

 But I'm afraid you're too late. What? You were the one who

 kept blabbing in that sermon how it's never too late to confess

 your sins. See? I can listen and take calls. It's true. God

 waits until the heart is ready. But the airlines are a little

 stricter, and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat. So if

 you'll excuse me. You getting on, too, miss? Uh, yes, but I

 couldn't... manage my bag. Be a dear and grab it for me?

 Hey. What are you doing? Taking you to the airport... with one

 quick detour. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Are you

 crazy? I can't miss my plane. Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying

 to get you to do god's work instead of going on your

 dream vacation to... Rwanda, where I'll be digging wells... for lepers. Well,

 your little friends are gonna have to wait. - Excuse me. -

 Whoa. Well, where did you u me from? We're headed off on

 our honeymoon. And we can't have any detours. They say you have

 to get to the airport three hours early for international flights. Oh,

 honey, relax. Since we caught Bin Laden, you can stroll on the

 plane anytime you want. It's just, I've done something, father, And I'm

 afraid that it's... unforgivable. God can forgive us for anything. Really? Anything?

 Yes. If we're willing to show that we are truly repentant. How?

 Well, it's not by what we say. It's by what we do.

 For instance, if we were talking about a crime... then confessing to

 the authorities would prove the intentions of our heart. That... is not

 an option. There are other people involved... innocent people. You can't ask

 to be absolved for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.

 You should go. You're gonna miss your flight. I don't wanna leave

 you, Carlos, not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay. Father

 Dugan, I don't see any way that I am ever going to

 be okay. Hey. Hey. I wish I could make you stop thinking

 about this. Yeah, me, too. I don't even know what I was

 looking for. There is no absolution for this thing. I just have

 to live with it. Every noise I'd hear at night, it was

 him. Every dark alley I passed, he was waiting for me. When

 I'd lie in bed, I was afraid he'd come find me. He

 was in my dreams... and in my nightmares. I couldn't escape him.

 And that's what I had to live with... until now. For the

 first time, I'm not scared. You did that for me. Yeah... by

 taking a man's life. Yes, you may have taken a life, but

 you also saved one. So if it's absolution you're looking for... I

 give it to you. - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey,

 is everything okay with the kids? Yeah, yeah, the... the kids are

 fine. I just... What? Did something happen? I really... need you right

 now. Okay. Morning. Morning. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Crap, crap,

 crap. - Come on. Come on. - Okay. - Watch out for

 the, uh... - Okay, okay, o... - Honey. Ooh. - No, I'm

 okay. Okay, go. Shh, shh, shh, shh. They're still asleep. Thank god.

 I'll start the coffee. Okay, you read my mind. - Hey. -

 Yeah? So last night... Yeah. We should talk about it. Uh-huh. I

 mean... If you wanna get back together... I'm open to that. But

 we have some serious problems that are gonna require serious work. Oh,

 god. Last night... uh... was... not about getting back together. Then what

 the hell was it about? I... I had a nightmare. Well... a-a

 nightmare? Are you kidding me? You've gotta understand. I'm having a lot

 of nightmares. This is such a scary time, and I really need

 you. That's-that's why I didn't want to tell the kids. Having you

 across the street makes me feel safe. You're unbelievable. You know what

 you do when you're scared, Lynette? You buy a night-light. You don't

 go have sex with the guy you are supposed to be separated

 from! I want french toast. - I hate french toast. I want

 pancakes. - Oh. Kids... there's something your mom and I need to

 tell you. Yeah. Why don't we sit down? Hey, I, uh, I

 know it's a barbecue, but isn't that a little casual? Yeah, um,

 I don't think I'm gonna go this year. Why don't you go

 without me? Hey, do I need to be worried? I told you.

 I'm fine. I don't mean worried about you. I mean worried about

 us. I thought this was some problem between you and your friends,

 but... the way you've been shutting me out, I'm starting to think

 you've got a problem with me. How could you say that? No

 matter what I'm going through, I would never let anything come between

 us. Yeah, I'm sure Tom and Lynette felt the same way. Look

 where they ended up. Well, I'm headed over there without you. No.

 I'm going with you. You're right. I do have a problem with

 the girls. It's about time I went over there and straightened it

 out. No! No way. You are not bringing Mike in on this.

 He's not gonna tell anyone. We can trust him. Oh, just like

 I could trust you when we agreed to keep this between us?

 Susan, we all empathize with your position, but I don't think it's

 smart to tell Mike. Well, he knows something is up. It's affecting

 our marriage. You know what's gonna affect my marriage? when my husband

 goes to prison. I think we should let her tell him. I

 can't believe this. We all made a pact that night. I don't

 remember anybody bringing up These extra conditions. Well, you weren't exactly asking

 anyone's opinion that night, were you, Bree? What is that supposed to

 mean? It means you elected yourself chairman of the... dead guy committee

 and started making decisions for everyone. Like you always do. Well, somebody

 had to, Susan, And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.

 I'm done talking about this. The only reason I came to this

 barbecue was to let you know that I am telling Mike. The

 hell you are. Aah! Oh, my god! Gaby! Gaby! - Trade Manning?

 - What, are you out of your mind? Think for a minute.

 When is his stock ever gonna be higher? Let me go! You

 could get a great player. Yeah, maybe a great quarterback, like, I

 don't know. Manning? - Ow! - Get off me! Girls, people can

 hear us! Ow! I told you we couldn't trust her! I can't

 see. Lynette! Aah! Oh! I got it! What the hell's going on?

 Uh, well... I... lost my earring, and the girls here were kind

 enough to help me look for it. Oh! There it is! I

 went food shopping yesterday. I kept having to put things back. I'd

 take a couple of cans of peaches. And then I'd remember that

 Tom was the only one who liked them, put them back. Sweet

 pickles... Tom. Put them back. I am so sorry. With everything that's

 been going on, I haven't been there for you. I guess we've

 all been guilty of that. I'm sorry, Susan. This is so damn

 hard. You know, the good thing about Mike and Tom not knowing

 is they can't be implicated. If something were to happen, at least

 they'd be okay. We are never gonna be able to tell anybody

 about this, are we? No. Are you gonna be able to live

 with that? I'm gonna try. It's only the best of friends who

 stay long after the party's over to help clean up... To cleanse

 the pain of a guilty conscience... to pick up the pieces... of

 a broken marriage... To sweep away the loneliness of keeping a secret.

 Yes... It's good to have friends who help clean up our messes.

 But every housewife knows that as soon as one mess is taken

 care of... another one appears. And we may find ourselves... right back
