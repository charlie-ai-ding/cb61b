 ":"Desperate

 Housewives S05E03 Kids Ain't Like Everybody Else (Les tyrans) (VO&VF+STFR&EN) Susan's new

 boyfriend met the family. - Who are you? -Hi I'm Mike, the

 ex-husband. Gaby's life was no longer glamorous. It's official. I've lost everything!

 First, our money, then my figure, now the last threads of our

 social standing. We have a home, and we have two beautiful little

 girls. Danielle's decision was devastating... Please, just don't take him! Benjamin is

 all I have. You're gonna have to find something else. And Edie's

 new husband showed a dark side. I would consider it a personal

 favor if you'd apologize to Edie. - No. It seems to me

 that a woman like you would like to keep the few friends

 that she has left. I think you'd better go. - Why would

 you bring me flowers? - 'Cause you got a computer, and I

 need to find out some stuff about Edie's husband. Benjamin Katz was

 6 years old, and there were a lot of things he didn't

 understand. He wasn't sure why the woman you call \"mommy\", isn't always

 your mother. Or how the man who was always there for him,

 could suddenly be taken away. Or why you could go for a

 ride, and never come back home. Yes, there were a lot of

 things Benjamin Katz couldn't understand. And no one seemed in a hurry

 to explain them. Here they come, finally. Things will be a little

 strange at first, so please, be on your best behavior. I do

 not require lectures on tact. I know. It's just that we've missed

 Benjy so much, and it's taken so many olive branches to get

 them to come back. - I'm aware of what's at stake. -

 Good. So if you feel an impulse to criticize something, you'll keep

 the thought to yourself. I've already started. What a delightfully ethnic ensemble!

 - Hey, Mom, Orson. - Hi, Danielle. I want to meet my

 husband, Leo. It's nice to meet you in person. Lovely to meet

 you. Who's this little linebacker? Hi, Benjy. Remember me? I'm not sure.

 That's okay. That's what this visit is for. Getting to know each

 other. We have you for the whole weekend, right? Yep, whole three

 days. Good. 'Cause we've made lots of plans. We're gonna take you

 to the circus if it's okay with your folks. Can I go,

 Danielle? \"Danielle\"? Did he just call you \"Danielle\"? Well, it is my

 name. Yes, I'm aware of that. I picked it. I'm just concerned

 people might view it as a sign of... disrespect. By \"people,\" you

 mean you? Leo, look at all the luggage you have here. I'll

 give you a hand. Oh, thanks. Let me be clear. I do

 not want him calling me \"Bree.\" Don't worry. I told him to

 call you \"granny.\" Yes, Benjamin Katz was only 6 years old, but

 even he could understand, this was going to be... a long weekend.

 Any child will tell you that where you find a playground, you

 will also find... bullies. Young tyrants who bring pain, intimidation... and violence.

 What can children do in the face of such torment? Well, there

 is one obvious option, but not every child is eager to go

 running home to mother, to mother. Hey, honey. How was the park?

 Wait. Hold on. Mommy just found her first gray hair. I need

 you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again.

 Look at your face. It's scratched. What happened? Nothing. And your shirt

 is ripped. That's the second time this week. Is someone picking on

 you? Who is it? Is it Jeffrey Hixon, that weird kid who

 eats paper? Is it Timmy Crowley? His mom slept in her car

 last night. Who knows what's going on there? Is it that boy

 from your birthday, the one who slugged the pony? Sweetie. I know

 you're upset, but you'll feel better if you talk about it. And

 there's nothing you can't tell me. I'm your mommy. I wanna talk

 to daddy. We'll give him a call. You're not gonna find another

 one in this condition. The car is a classic. What do you

 think, Nabila? I like it. I don't love it. Tell you what.

 Gaby and I want to find our car a nice home. So

 I'm prepared to knock a grand off. What do you say? I

 say knock off 5 grand, and we'll talk. Come on. It's already

 priced way below blue book, not to mention it's mint. This is

 not mint. Can you not see this ding in the bumper here?

 This car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds. By the time

 someone says, \"Wow, a ding!\" you're in the next county. 4 grand,

 you got yourself a deal. Deal. What? No! No, no deal! The

 nondriving blind guy does not speak for me. would you excuse us?

 We've been trying to move this car for a month. We need

 the cash. Isn't there any way we can keep it? This car's

 the last thing I have that tells the world, \"I'm better than

 you.\" Sorry, babe. We have to pay the mortgage. We can't afford

 to be better than anyone. Here. Take good care of her. Actually,

 it's not for us. It's for our nanny. That one hurt. What'd

 you dig up on Mr. X.? You mean Dave? Nothing yet. -

 It's been two days. What gives? - For starters, when I search

 for \"Dave williams,\" I get a million and a half hits. To

 narrow it down, I'm gonna need more information like, where he was

 born, went to school, did he serve time in the military. If

 he served time, it was in the state pen. Morning, ladies. -

 Sick bastard... - How are you? Your sprinkler system working okay now?

 Like a charm. And thanks again. I've never been able to get

 that to work. I hear ya. To program those things, you need

 an engineering degree. You got one of those? Anyway... really appreciate it.

 Take care. I just can't go through with this. He just strikes

 me as so nice. That's supposed to comfort me, given your track

 record with men? Katherine, please. The guy is bad news. I can't

 prove it, but I feel it in my bones. I can't sit

 around doing nothing when I know that Edie's waking up every morning

 next to him. If anyone finds out we're doing this... No one

 will know. And when they do, they'll probably thank us. Because I'm

 telling ya, this guy is up to something. Cleaning out the old

 garage - my deepest sympathy. You settling in okay? They finally delivered

 my flat screen. I was dying without it. It is 65 inches.

 Sweet! The play-offs are on. You should come check it out. It's

 like being right on the field. Lynette's really busting my hump about

 clearing this place out, so... Maybe later. The game doesn't start for

 a couple hours. - We could order giant sandwiches. - Sorry but,

 check back with me, make sure I survive this whole thing. Why

 are there two piles? That's the pile that I'm throwing away, and

 this is the stuff I still need. You need unopened mountain climbing

 equipment from 1986? You don't climb mountains. Not yet, but someday. You

 know... who knows? I know. You get winded just climbing out of

 the tub. You're never gonna climb a mountain. You know what else

 you're never gonna do? Learn german, make your own beer or... have

 8 minute abs. Not the ab-tastic! Toss it, and keep tossing until

 this 2-car garage can hold at least one car. Tell me you're

 not getting rid of your bass. No point in hanging on to

 it. Being in a band... just one more thing I'll never do.

 Before he moved, Mike and I, we used to get together on

 saturdays and just... jam. Man, that was fun. You know, I play

 the drums. Maybe you and I should jam sometime. - I guess

 we could. - Maybe even later today? You know what? Just give

 me a couple hours. I gotta stash these old Playboys. I'll see

 you later. Remember, you can't just start grilling Edie, or she'll get

 suspicious. We have to be subtle. I'll just follow your lead. Sorry

 I'm late. What a great idea! I haven't done this in ages

 - a fun lunch with the girls. Yeah, it's fun. Where was

 Dave born? What? We were just wondering where he got his great...

 manners. He's got that gentle bearing of a... southern gentleman. No, he's

 from somewhere in the midwest. \"Somewhere\"? You don't know where your husband

 grew up? He showed me a picture of his childhood home once.

 It had a cow in it. I lost interest. Honestly, how can

 you be married to a guy and not know these things? You

 know what? I think it's time to order. Where's our waitress? I'll

 be right with you, Mrs. Mayfair. No problem, Debbie. You take your

 time. She's such a sweet girl. She's saving money for college. Speaking

 of which... - where did Dave go to college? - Come on,

 Debbie! While we're young! - I don't know. - All right. -

 What about high school? - Why are you asking me these questions?

 It's just odd that you're married to some guy - you don't

 know anything about him. - Other than the fact, that he's a

 lovely man. He... fixed my sprinkler. I don't want to talk about

 this anymore. I'm going to the ladies' room. Your subtle approach got

 us nowhere. I've been through a lot with this baby. I hate

 to sell her but, with my new sports car coming, I don't

 really need it. Here she is. How's it look? - Be glad

 you're blind. - We have to be practical. We just need something

 to get us from point \"A\" to point \"B.\" - Let's buy

 the thing. - Just let me handle this. So... do we have

 a sale? I don't know... We like it. We don't love. No

 one buys a car like this and loves it. It's all about

 the price. And you're not gonna do better. About that price, you're

 gonna have to drop it. Look at all these dents. It's also

 missing three hubcaps, and it's got a hanger for an antenna. Full

 disclosure - it's a piece of crap. You want it or not?

 I'll tell you what. Since your mom and I are dear friends,

 I'll take it off your hands if you knock off $300. And

 since my mom and you are dear friends, I'll resist the urge

 to flip you the bird. Unless you lower this price, we're walking...

 right now. See ya. I mean it. This is it. - Fine.

 - Fine. Fine. Knock off $200 and we'll give you cash. 100.

 Will you at least have it washed? I'll empty the ashtray. Final

 offer. Damn you. You beat me again! Curse you and your diabolical

 checkers prowess. All right, Orson. Don't overexcite him on the upholstery. So,

 Danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish

 for your welcome home party? I can do anything so long as

 it complements beef tenderloin. Actually, we don't eat meat. We're vegetarians. Excuse

 me? So is Benjamin. Since when? Since I realized that meat was

 a byproduct of murder. Would it be more acceptable if I shopped

 for a suicidal pork loin? It's no big deal. I'll just make

 a nice Risotto. This isn't about dinner. This is about her nutty

 liberal politics getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition. He gets

 all the protein he needs from cheese and beans d tofu. This

 isn't just about nutrition. Do you want him to be teased at

 school every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox? Actually, that

 won't be an issue. Danielle is homeschooling him. Excuse me? You're teaching

 him? Yes. I take it you have an opinion? So instead of

 sending him to a proper school, you're gonna give him the benefit

 of your straight C average? He's only 6, and he's already reading

 at a third grade level. What happens next year when he overtakes

 you? Best behavior, remember? I am sorry, but am I supposed to

 sit by while she degrades his body and his mind? Fine. Cricize

 my parenting all you want. I don't care, because you don't get

 to decide how he's raised anymore. I'm his mother. And by the

 way, mark your calendars, 'cause seven years from next saturday - Benjamin's

 Bar Mitzvah. Isn't this cool? Dave brought his drums over so we

 could jam. - Your boy is pretty good. - And we figured

 out. We got bass, we got drums. Mike plays guitar. I think

 Orson plays keyboards. You see where I am going with this? I

 do, but I'm hoping I'm wrong. - We're gonna start a garage

 band! - And I wasn't! If we get good enough, we can

 even get a couple of gigs. How fun would that be? \"Gigs\"?

 Did you just say \"gigs\"? All's we need is a little time

 to practice, a few nights a week, some weekends. What? Just until

 we get the rhythm section all dialed in. I need to... dial

 you in to some gigs you already have, which are running a

 restaurant, being a husband and a father. And I thought you said

 you wanted to spend more time with your family. But we could

 play clubs. He's just having a little fun. Guys need to blow

 off steam. Could you just... for a sec? You know I'm right.

 You're far too busy for this. You can't just decide for me

 like that. If I wanna play bass, I will play bass. I'm

 not hurting anybody. Those of us with hearing beg to differ. You

 know what? Please leave our rehearsal space. Come on, Tom. This is

 not your... It's mine! No! Give it! Give it! - Give it

 to me! - It's mine! Guys! Knock it off back there. God.

 What now? What's up? You sold me a lemon. That's what's up.

 - What are you talking about? - Your car! I took it

 to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot. That. Yeah. It's

 been giving me trouble for years. Just use the jug. - What

 jug? - It's in the trunk. You keep it full of water,

 and when the radiator overheats, you fill it up. And try not

 going up hills and stay in the shade as much as possible.

 I can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun. Sorry. If you

 want a car with no flaws, buy a new one. Or I

 could get the radiator fixed, which is gonna cost $300, which you

 are paying for. Remember full disclosure? Crap? This is your car. It's

 your problem. That's it. I wanna talk to your mother! She's in

 a meeting right now. Can I take a message? Damn it, Andrew.

 You tell Bree to call me by the end of the day.

 May I ask what it's regarding? We'll talk about it more later,

 buddy. Why don't you go play for a while? - What did

 he say? - He won't tell me who's picking on him, but

 he did ask me to teach him how to fight. He's only

 5. I don't want him fighting. I'm sorry, but every boy has

 to learn how to throw a punch eventually. If you wanna give

 him a leg up, you could teach him a little Capoeira. Capo-what?

 It's a brazilian martial art that incorporates dance. 'Cause there's nothing scarier

 than a guy coming at ya with jazz hands. That's funny, but

 actually, the dance part's to catch your opponent off guard. - Like

 that? - No. There's a little more nuance to it. Like that.

 Where's the \"dance\" part? There it is, Ginger! You know what, boys?

 Not in the house. Oh, my God! - Give it back! It's

 my ball! - It's my ball now. You leave him alone. Is

 that who's been picking on you? Juanita Solis? She is going to

 get a big surprise, because your daddy is about to turn you

 into a killing machine. M.J., can I talk to your mom for

 a second? What? I can't teach him to hit a girl. That's

 not just any girl. You saw her. She could take down a

 small deer. It doesn't matter. If it wears a skirt, it's off-limits.

 That is sexist. If feminism means anything, it's that it's okay for

 a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked. You, teach him

 one of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things. I'm with Mike. You

 can't hit girls. Couple of wusses. I'll handle it myself. Oops! Didn't

 see that coming. Just for that, I'm breaking my rule about not

 hitting girls. We have a problem. I just saw Juanita push M.J.

 down. Really? It's not the first time. Juanita's been bullying him. I'm

 sorry. I'll talk to her. Thank you. And don't worry. No one

 will hear about this from me. Hear what? That M.J.'s getting beat

 up by a little girl. A girl... Are you suggesting that Juanita

 is fat for her age? Juanita's fat for your age. Let's face

 it. M.J. could get beaten up by a kitten. You know what?

 Maybe you could teach your daughter how to use her words and

 not her fists. Or maybe you could teach your son to grow

 a pair! What you looking at? Just some old pictures. Can you

 guess who that little girl is? That's your mom way back when

 she was your age. What's she eating? A hot dog. No way.

 Yes. Your mother loved hot dogs. Every day at lunchtime, she'd say

 to me, \"Mommy, I want hot dog.\" How come she doesn't eat

 them now? Because she's all grown-up. Hot dogs and hamburgers are what

 make little boys and girls grow up to be big and strong.

 And now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore. Doesn't mommy

 want me to be big and strong? I've been asking myself that

 all day. Maybe she's afraid if you get big, you'll leave home

 and go play for the Red Sox. But I want to get

 big. I want to play baseball. In that case... Can I? You

 have to promise not to tell your mommy. What do you think?

 It's like tofu, only better. Yes. It is. When Tom Scavo threw

 himself into his new hobby, his wife told herself it was a

 phase, and it would pass quickly. But three hours later, she realized,

 it could not pass quickly enough. So Lynette began to plot against

 her husband's instrument of torture. - Careful, honey. - Sorry. You could

 break your dad's guitar and... It was at that moment, her daughter

 provided her an idea for a... simple accident... and... a clean alibi.

 Damn it! Is everything all right? It was lying in the middle

 of the floor! How in the worid did that happen? Has Penny

 been playing in here again? I've told her a million times! I'm

 sure it was an accident. - Please don't yell at her. -

 This was a $1, 600 bass. I can't afford to replace it.

 Penny Lynn Scavo! Where is she? She's up in her room. I'm

 gonna go play outside. Wait. You forgot your whistle. This is just

 to be on the safe side. If Juanita comes around, you just

 blow it. I'll be right there. Good boy. Give me back my

 whistle! Juanita Solis, don't you move! You are in big trouble! What's

 on your head? Nevermind. What did you do to M.J.? He wouldn't

 let me blow his whistle. So your solution was to push him

 down? Do you think that's nice? How would you feel if someone

 did that to you? I wouldn't care. Really... - You don't think

 it would hurt? - Even if it did... I'm not a crybaby

 like M.J. I'm sorry. I just wanted you to see how it

 felt. Are you okay? I saw that! Kids, get inside! First off,

 it wasn't as bad as it looked. Really? 'Cause it looked like

 you body-slammed my daughter. I barely tapped her. She was milking it.

 That's your defense? You were only assaulting her \"a little\"? I was

 trying to teach her not to be a bully- something she should

 have learned from her mother. I'm sorry. I was too busy trying

 to explain to her why M.J. doesn't wear a dress like all

 the other little giris. This conversation is over. Tell Bob and Lee

 that I'll pay for the dent in their lawn. You did not!

 I did. You know what? We've both been incredibly childish here, and

 it is time one of us took the high road, so I

 am now going to walk away. Please take note of this conflict

 resolution, and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter. You

 can dye that hair all you want, but the gray's just gonna

 keep coming. And they call me white trash. You got a minute?

 Sure. Come on in. I heard there was a little accident. So...

 I got this for Tom. You bought Tom a new bass? It's

 not as smooth as his old one, but it's good. We can't

 accept this. It's mostly selfish on my part. I was having too

 much fun. Sorry, but, maybe you could go skateboarding with Orson. All

 right. Forget about me. Tom was having fun. And from what I've

 seen, he needs it. And what makes you think you know what

 my husband needs? Just something that I saw the other day, when

 you were, making him get rid of all his things. You mean

 his junk? It may be junk to you, but to Tom... that

 was stuff he was gonna get around to. You know what a

 midlife crisis is? I'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a

 red convertible. I think I know. But you know how it happens?

 A man gets to a certain age, and he realizes... he's gonna

 die someday. Really die. And what's worse is that he's everything he's

 ever gonna be. He's never gonna be rich. He's never gonna climb

 a mountain. Some guys do, bad things when they get those thoughts

 in their heads. By comparison, playing in a garage band, it seems

 pretty harmless. So... my marriage is in trouble, and you're gonna save

 it by giving Tom a bass? I'm not. You are. Most of

 the guys in my class went into corporate law but, I wanted

 to do something that would influence environmental policy. That's how he ended

 up at the E.P.A. Where did you study law? Cornell. I'm jealous.

 I always wished that I'd gone to a school like Cornell but,

 it just wasn't in the cards for me. How about you, Dave?

 Me? No. Wasn't in my cards, either. So where did you go?

 After listening to Leo, I'd be embarrassed to tell you. So... E.P.A.

 What's your opinion on global warming - fact or fiction? Hold on,

 darling. Mrs. McCluskey asked you a question. Tell her where you went

 to school. I think she was just making conversation. Then why don't

 you tell me where you went? After all, I am your wife.

 Shouldn't I know? Actually, I didn't go to college. I took a

 job out of high school because my family was having a hard

 time. Not having a degree is something that has always been embarrassing

 to me, especially when I'm with people... who do. So, my darling,

 is there anything else you'd like to quiz me about in public?

 My... childhood stuttering? My dad's drinking problems? No. I'm... good. I came

 to say I'm sorry. You attacked my child and then me. Why

 should I even listen to you? I brought booze. Come on in.

 I have this rule, no toy guns. Except everything that M.J. picks

 up, whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything, he pretends it's a

 gun. What do you expect? He's a boy. That's my point! I

 know nothing about raising boys. And I think M.J. has figured this

 out, so he goes straight to Mike whenever there's a problem. But

 that's okay. Mike's a great Dad. Sure, on alternate weekends. That's fine...

 until... M.J. needs his daddy, and his daddy's not there. It's not

 your fault. We split up, so it's at least half my fault

 any way you slice it. If it's any consolation, Carlos is a

 hands-on, full-time dad, and I still feel like I'm not getting the

 job done, like... I'm not preparing them enough. Preparing them for what?

 For how hard life is. I have to admit, when you told

 me Juanita was bullying M.J., my first thought was, thank God! Let

 her do the pushing, just as long as she's not a victim.

 I don't see any kid of yours being a victim. You're the

 strongest person I know. I used to be. Look at my life.

 I've been beaten down. I thought I had you beaten today, and

 the next thing I knew, I was eating grass. Today doesn't count.

 Today I was mad. Maybe you need to get mad more often.

 Maybe you're right. This is nice. We should rumble all the time.

 To Susan Mayer, good mom. To Gabrielle Solis, another good Mom. Mommy,

 we're hungry! So? There's waffles in the freezer! And get mommy some

 ice! Isn't this nice? For the first time in years, my family

 is all here under the same roof. Here's to many more meals

 together. Welcome home. Cheers. I don't feel good, Danielle. I think I'm

 gonna be sick. Let's get you to the powder room. Here we

 are - mushroom risotto. There's an unfortunate coincidence. I'm so sorry. I'll

 clean it up. You take Benjy upstairs. I'll get it. Orson, could

 you get the mop, please? Oh, my God. Is that meat? Of

 course not. Does this look like meat to you? It's... hard to

 tell. Just so we're clear, what I'm about to throw up is

 a western omelet. That is not meat. That piece right there, that's

 definitely meat! Still waiting on that mop. - What did grandma give

 you to eat? - She said not to tell. You gave him

 meat and then told him to lie? I gave him a hot

 dog, all right? He liked it so much, he asked for another.

 Two hot dogs? I can see the second one was clearly a

 mistake. Come on, Leo. We're leaving. Danielle, please. I'm sorry, She's made

 it impossible for us to stay in this house. Danielle, wait. We

 can still drink, right? I've apologized till I'm blue in the face,

 but they're still leaving in the morning. You're not speaking to me,

 either? They're just mad. Things will be better next time. You honestly

 think there'll be a next time? It took us three years to

 talk them into this visit. It took you one day... to ruin

 it. I'm truly sorry. It's just, seeing... all these mistakes that she's

 making with Benjamin, it's just so hard for me. You know what

 hard for me? When I left for prison, Benjamin was in my

 house, he was in my life. He called me \"daddy.\" And when

 I came home, he was gone. And you think that's my fault?

 Yes, I do. You weren't here. She came back. She was married

 to a lawyer. And don't forget, she is his mother! I tried

 to fight, but... You should've fought harder! I was on my knees.

 I was sobbing. She said \"no\" and then ripped him out of

 my arms. You have no right to say that to me. You

 kind of blindsided me tonight. I know. I am so sorry. I

 was clearly uncomfortable. I don't understand why you kept pressing me. Honestly,

 it was all Karen McCluskey's fault. Really? How so? She kept asking

 me all this stuff about your background, why I don't know more

 about you and... I should've just never let her get to me.

 It's okay, sweetie. Now I understand. Kind of sad when you think

 about it. What do you mean? Maybe you guys don't notice because

 you're so used to her. But her behavior reminds me of my

 grandmother, when we first started to notice... the dementia, that is. You

 think Karen's going senile? I remember my poor grandmother... started getting so

 paranoid. She thought people were breaking into her house and... stealing her

 things. We finally had to put her in a home. I just

 hope that doesn't happen to Karen. I want my 300 bucks. I

 told you. It's your car. You deal with it. That's it? No

 compassion? No, \"hey, let's split the bill and call it even\"? Look

 at it this way. You're not losing 300 bucks. You're gaining a

 valuable lesson - buyer beware. True. Here's a valuable lesson for you.

 What's wrong with you? Give me my money, or next time we're

 trading paint! - You're bluffing. - I am tired of being a

 victim. And trust me, that is no bluff. You touch my car,

 and you're paying for it. Luckily, I'm insured. Wait. Our policy lapsed.

 Hope you'got good coverage. Wait! I'll get my checkbook. I prefer cash.

 Bullies... any adult will tell you, the playground is not the only

 place to find them. Everywhere you look, you can find people unconcerned

 or unaware of the pain they inflict. It might be a neighbor,

 preying on the suspicions of her friend... Or a daughter punishing the

 choices of her mother. Or a housewife seeking justice from the man

 who sold her a car. Yes... There are bullies everywhere. And the

 worst are the ones who take advantage of you without you ever
