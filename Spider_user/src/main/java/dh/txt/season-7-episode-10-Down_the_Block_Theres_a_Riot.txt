 ":"MARY

 ALICE: Previously on Desperate Housewives. I was thinking about this great guy

 from my past. An evening of drinking led to a confession. Tom.

 Tom Scavo? Love of my life. I have to talk to you

 about something really important. Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail with a

 puny engagement ring on the side? Keith's plan to propose was thwarted.

 I really do love your son. Yeah, I see you with someone

 more your own age. What are you doing? Memorizing your face. Gabby

 said goodbye to her biological daughter Grace. A halfway house for convicts

 on our street? I now own seven houses on Wisteria Lane. And

 Paul needed one more house... I can offer you well above market

 value. How much above market value? We have to stick together. ...

 to achieve his goal. We know what they look like. We know

 how they dress. And we know how they behave. Yes, we can

 all recognize the wrong kind of people. And when we see them

 coming, we do what we have to to protect ourselves. Lynette. How

 are you this fine day? Who are these people? Old friends. Ex-con

 friends? Arert you jumping the gun? Until the Homeowners' Association votes, you

 don't have approval for your project. These men have volunteered to get

 my halfway house ready. Most of them live in a dreadful facility

 on skid row. I told them if they participated in the remodel,

 I could get them transferred here. You're wasting their time. Because this

 place is never going to open. Oh, I think it will. And

 won't it be nice for these men to live on a street

 where children play in their front yards and people don't lock their

 doors at night? Why is Paul so sure the house will open?

 He doesn't have the votes. He's got something up his sleeve. What

 it is, I don't know. Are we positive no one's planning on

 selling him their home? We can't take anyone for granted. We need

 to talk to everyone on the street. Good idea. We'll shore up

 support. And if we sense anyone is starting to waver... How could

 they? Everyone knows what's at stake here. I pray they do. I

 love this neighborhood. I don't want it to change. Let's go. MARY

 ALICE: And with that, my friends went to work trying to stop

 Paul Young. He knew what they were up to. But he didn't

 care. He should have. Paul had forgotten what ordinary men and women

 will do to protect themselves from the wrong kind of people. It

 was just before sunrise on Wisteria Lane, when a cab arrived and

 a woman departed. She left the street quietly. But news of her

 disappearance would soon spread, and the sound would be deafening. But first,

 a young man in love had plans to make some noise of

 his own. Bree, I love you. And I want this to be

 the last morning you wake up without me next to you. It's

 6:00! How long have you been kneeling there? I don't know, but

 after you answer this question, you're gonna need to help me up.

 Bree, will you do me the honor... May I say something first?

 After that embarrassing night in the restaurant, I really appreciate you taking

 another stab at this. But... That's a long \"but.\" I'm getting up.

 Hold on. I'm not saying no. Exactly. It's just so soon to

 be talking about marriage. Maybe I can use this as a tiny

 napkin ring. Wait! I have a proposal for you. I love you,

 too, Keith Watson. And I also want this to be the last

 morning I wake up without you next to me. So I'm asking

 you, will you do me the honor of moving in with me?

 (LAUGHING) For the third time, no. I'm not gonna sell my house

 to Paul Young. I'm sorry, I just had to make sure. The

 vote is today. Do you really think that I would let dangerous

 ex-cons move in next to my own mother? I don't know. As

 a teenager you were pretty nasty. But you're all grown up now

 and so very nice. Thank you for your support. Excuse me, Lynette

 Scavo? - Yeah. - Brent Ferguson. President of the Hydrangea Circle Homeowners'

 Association. We've all heard about your situation, we'd love to help. Really?

 Sure. Last year we had a similar scare on our street. Some

 old hippie wanted to open up a drug rehab center on our

 block. I remember. Didrt that old hippie get beat up by a

 neighbor? (LAUGHING) He made the mistake of mouthing off to one of

 my neighbors who's an ex-Green Beret. Newspaper made it sound way worse

 than it was. Well, nice to meet you. You say the word,

 and I will have the Homeowners' Associations of 10 different streets here

 to back you folks up. Whoever's trying to open this halfway house,

 we could really scare the hell out of him. Well, I appreciate

 your offer, but I think we'd prefer to handle our situation in

 a more civilized manner. Okay. Well, you change your mind, you know

 where to find me. Hydrangea Circle. Got it. So we're at dinner,

 and Renee is going on and on about this guy she once

 had a fling with and she still has feelings for. And then

 she gets so drunk that she tells me it was Tom Scavo!

 What am I suppose to do with that? You look so hot

 right now... Mike, focus. I know you've been in Alaska for a

 month. A month, 19 days and seven hours. Yesterday I put boobs

 on a snowman. I need to come home. I miss you, too.

 So am I making too much out of this? I mean, it

 happened 20 years ago. And Tom's a good guy, right? Yeah, he

 is. But even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right.

 Interesting point. Wish you hadrt made it while you were 2,000 miles

 away and clearly horny. (LAUGHS) Susan, I am in the middle of

 nowhere. The only female I've seen has antlers. So, should I tell

 Lynette? Not just yet. Maybe just keep an eye on the situation.

 Thanks for the advice. Just so you know, when you come home,

 I'm gonna make you forget all about that snowman. Her name is

 Carol. Okay, you really need to come home. (SNIFFLING) Mommy? Why are

 you crying? Oh. Just having a sad day. You've been having a

 lot of sad days. Is it because Grace left? Why would you

 say that? That was when you started being sad. The day she

 went away. No. It's just, you know, I got really close to

 that whole family. And I knew I was gonna miss Carmen and

 Hector... And Grace. Why are you wearing my necklace? I'm playing dress-up.

 Not with real diamonds. Hand it over. Fine. Here. Take it. Jeesh.

 And I don't want you playing in my room anymore. You understand?

 I liked you better when you were crying. Mitzi! It's Lynette Scavo!

 If you're in there, please open up. (CAR APPROACHING) - Hey, Lee.

 - Hey. You wouldn't happen to know where Mitzi Kinsky is, would

 you? No. Why would I? I thought maybe you and Paul convinced

 her to sell her house, and then stashed her away someplace for

 safe-keeping. Lynette, I have to say, I'm offended. I have to say,

 I couldn't care less. You know, for the millionth time, I had

 no idea what he was up to. You were his real estate

 agent. You didn't think it odd, him buying all these houses on

 one street? He was paying me commissions. What am I supposed to

 do? Complain? Maybe you didn't know. And if Paul is voted down

 at tonight's meeting, I'm sure, in time, people will forget you had

 anything to do with this. - I... - But, Lee, if he

 finds a way to open that house, I don't think anyone on

 this street will ever forgive you. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? PAUL: Look out

 your window. Oh, it's you. I'm hanging up now. Look, I understand

 you're annoyed with me. I feel awful. Well, you should. Because of

 you, everyone on this street hates me now. That's why I'm calling.

 I put you in an awful position. I'd like to make it

 up to you. And how are you gonna do that? Well, first,

 you should know that Mitzi Kinsky agreed to sell me her house

 yesterday. What? I suggested she leave the Lane for a while. A

 taxi picked her up this morning. Oh, my God. So, why are

 you telling me this? Because I have a little proposition for you.

 And given how the neighbors feel about you these days, I suggest

 you listen. Hey, Mitzi. It's Lynette. Still haven't heard from you, I

 need to make sure we're all on the same page for tonight's

 meeting. Call me back. (EX CLAIMING IN FRUSTRATION) Hey. I know you're

 probably busy, I really need to talk to somebody. I would love

 to, but the meeting's tonight. I got a bunch of phone calls

 to make. Can't you talk to Susan or Bree? No. It's gotta

 be you. Why? You're the only woman I know who's lost a

 child. ...and ever since Grace left, I can't stop crying. I break

 down at the mall, at the market. I'm starting to freak myself

 out. I was the same way after I lost the baby. I

 finally went to a therapist. I didn't know that. Yeah. Did it

 help? It did. In fact, she had me do something you might

 want to try. LYNETTE: Write Grace a letter. GABRIELLE: A letter? LYNETTE:

 You don't send it. You just pour out your feelings. Tell Grace

 how happy you are to have found her. And how much you

 love her. Trust me. After you've written it, you'll feel so much

 better. (CRYING) CARLOS: Gabby, where are my keys? I have them. Wait.

 I'll be right down. You're moving in together? No one's more surprised

 than I am. So you did propose to her. I tried. Bree

 said she's not ready for that yet. This was the compromise. I

 figure we'll do this for a while, then in a couple of

 months, we'll start talking about a wedding. Yeah. I guess that could

 happen. (LAUGHS) You \"guess\"? It's just if Bree was in love with

 you, seems she'd want to lock it down. That's all. Dad, I

 get where she's coming from. She just divorced a guy. That's my

 point. She's ready for some fun. Not something serious. She may be

 looking at you as a diversion. No. Bree loves me. This is

 going somewhere. Just make sure. If Bree's not willing to make some

 sort of a commitment, then maybe... Dad, you're starting to piss me

 off. I hope I'm wrong. I really do. And if I am,

 you let me know when to rent the tux for the wedding.

 (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Yeah. Okay. Any sign of Mitzi? Not yet. God, where

 could she be? If she sold her house to Paul, she better

 be on the run. Not that it'll do any good, I'll still

 hunt her down and kill her. Lynette... We've been here for 20

 minutes. Don't you think it's time you started? Relax, Paul. We're not

 taking the vote until everyone's here. Well, while we're waiting, may I

 make an announcement? I suppose. May I have your attention, please? I

 wanted you all to know that the Mayor of Fairview will be

 here Friday to present me with an award for outstanding public service.

 - What? - What? Yes, it's sort of a big deal. And

 I would love it if all of my friends would attend. If

 you'd invite your enemies, you'd get a bigger crowd. (ALL SNICKERING) I

 love your sense of humor, Mrs. McCluskey. How we'll all miss it

 after you're gone. Hmm. Hold it. Now what kind of public service

 did you do? The halfway house, of course. Oh, shoot. Did I

 bury the lead? I now have all the votes I need to

 open it. How do you have the votes? Someone sold you their

 house? Oh, yes. We shouldn't have sold. We should have just gone

 under with the rest of the neighborhood. Which would have been very

 noble and very stupid. Mitzi sold. She's not gonna be around for

 everybody on this street to pummel. Which means they would have taken

 their anger out on you. Didrt have a choice. What the hell?

 Mitzi, what are you doing here? I live here. Well, I guess

 you would have noticed if I was a hot guy with abs.

 But we thought you left. Weirdest thing. I get this call. This

 guy says he has a job for me in the city. Puts

 me up in a nice hotel. And then he never showed. And

 I got stuck with the mini-bar charges. So, wait. You didn't sell

 your house to Paul Young? (EX CLAIMS QUESTIONINGLY) Please. I'm not gonna

 screw over my neighbors. LYNETTE: Lee! What the hell have you done

 to us? - (DOORBELL RINGING) - No, I'm sorry. Lynette is not

 here. She's trying to deal with this whole Paul Young mess. Yes,

 I will have her get back to you. Okay. Okay. What is

 happening to this neighborhood? Some van just pulled up and these creepy

 characters are getting out. That is a school bus, Renee. Those are

 children. Well, I don't like the way they're looking at me. Can

 you come over and install a deadbolt on my door? Sure. I

 will be right over as soon as I find where Lynette keeps

 the toolbox. Great. I have to jump in the shower. I will

 leave the key under the mat. You know, I had to use

 that key the other night. Yeah? Yeah. We went out and Renee

 got hammered. So, I had to take her in and put her

 to bed. Well, that was nice of you. Yeah. And she told

 me this fascinating story about this guy that she had a fling

 with 20 years ago. (STAMMERING) Why... Why was that fascinating? Well, apparently

 the one weekend they spent together made quite an impact on her.

 (CHUCKLES) Well, did she say anything else about that guy? No. Not

 really. Hmm. Only that his name was Tom Scavo. Okay, look. This

 happened before Lynette and I were married. It meant nothing. Well, it

 meant something to Renee. She's still in love with you. She said

 that? She slurred it. Look, this is not something I wanted to

 know. But now that I do, I am in a horrible position.

 No, no, no. You can't tell Lynette. She would freak out. I

 don't want to tell her. But she's my best friend. And I'm

 freaking out knowing that you're at Renee's fixing her deadbolt while she's

 in the shower. Look, this was forever ago. And I don't feel

 anything for her. A beautiful woman who still wants you is living

 a hundred yards away, and her breasts are 95 yards away. Why

 do you want that temptation? Hey, I didn't ask her to move

 here. Well, maybe it's time you ask her to leave. So, the

 whole right side of the closet is yours. And I emptied out

 the top drawers of the bureau for your socks and those cute

 little boxer briefs you wear. Thank you. And after we've gotten you

 settled, I want us to go over and tell the girls. They're

 going to die. Bree Van De Kamp living in sin. Come here.

 What is it? We love each other, right? Mmm-hmm. Why don't you

 just go ahead and wear this? Keith... I don't know, if marriage

 is where we're headed, I just keep thinking, \"What's the harm?\" Because

 we're not there yet. Look, I'm not trying to rush you. But

 I need a bigger commitment than just the top couple drawers in

 your bureau. (CHUCKLES) We talked about this. I'm not ready to make

 that kind of promise. That's a problem. Because I don't want to

 wake up one day and find out that I was just some

 diversion that you needed to amuse yourself while getting through your divorce.

 If you really think I feel that way, then why are you

 even here? I'm starting to wonder that myself. (EXHALING) Do you think

 us living together is a mistake? No. No, I think \"us\" is

 a mistake. I wish we had been nicer to Paul. I wish

 we had stood by him when he was on trial. I think

 about what he must have gone through in prison, and I understand

 his rage. I do. But I won't allow him to destroy this

 street. It's not right. Don't worry. We will stop this son of

 a bitch. That's a promise. Hey, MJ's spending the night at a

 friend's house. So I don't care if this protest goes all night,

 I'm here to the bitter end. How can I help? - We

 need more signs painted. - Okay. Hey, Susan, look on that paper.

 We came up with a whole list of slogans. Just so you

 know, we got plenty of \"Think About the Children,\" and we need

 a lot more \"Who Let The Cons Out?\" So what exactly are

 we hoping to accomplish with all this? The Mayor is in a

 close race for re-election. He needs every vote he can get. If

 we can make a big enough stink in front of the news

 cameras, maybe we can embarrass him into shutting that place down. So,

 if this protest works and the place doesn't open, what happens to

 all those ex-cons? What happens to them? I mean, if they don't

 get to stay here, where will they go? They'll just go back

 to where they came from, or some house in another neighborhood. But

 what if that neighborhood doesn't want them either? Well... I mean, if

 they've done their time and they need a second chance, wouldn't it

 be better for them to be in a nice neighborhood? In theory,

 yes. But that's not the way the world works. We have to

 think about our neighborhood, our children... Ourselves. Don't be cute. Some of

 these men may have good intentions. But some of them could still

 be really bad guys. But if we don't even try to help

 them, are we so sure we're the good guys? (DOORBELL RINGING) Richard?

 Keith told me what happened. I'm so sorry. Thank you. So, why

 are you here? (LAUGHS) He also mentioned all that work that needs

 to be done in your backyard. Luckily, I taught him everything he

 knows. Wait. You don't need to do that. It's not a problem.

 I'll have it done by the end of the week. But if

 you want to thank me, will you find me something cold to

 drink? Mayor Franklin. What an honor. Paul Young. You must be the

 Good Samaritan I've heard so much about. This is my wife, Beth.

 I've never met a celebrity before. (CHUCKLING) Well, now you have. The

 media will be arriving shortly, as well as some of the Mayor's

 supporters. With the election just a few days away, we thought this

 could be a terrific photo op. No problem. While you're waiting, would

 you like a tour of the facility? Absolutely. I must say, I

 don't know how you got your neighbors to agree to a halfway

 house on their street, but they must think a lot of you.

 Honestly? This is all happening because of what I think of them.

 (DOOR OPENING) - Richard, is that you? - (DOOR CLOSING) The lemonade's

 not quite ready yet. Richard! Would you like a sandwich with that...

 Who are you? This the halfway house? Uh, no. That's next door.

 So I guess we're gonna be neighbors. Well, I'm sure you're in

 a hurry to get settled in over there, so... I'm in no

 hurry. What's going on in here? This gentleman just wandered into my

 home... I made a mistake. Wort happen again. It better not. (EXHALING

 HEAVILY) You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It was just taken by surprise.

 You're shaking. Come on. Come on. No, really. Really, I'm fine. It's

 just... Thank you for taking care of that. What are you doing?

 Something I've wanted to do for a long time. You're gonna have

 to leave. Okay, maybe I misread some signals. There have been no

 signals. I was dating your son. Okay. If that's the way you

 feel, then I'll finish up out back and go. I want you

 to leave now. Look, I made an error in judgment. I'm sorry.

 Please let me finish the work. I said now. I will leave

 when I'm finished. Well, here's trouble. A bunch of geeks with \"Vote

 Franklin\" signs just showed up. Looks like we're outnumbered now. Oh. I'm

 not worried. Who the hell are they? The cavalry. Hey, guys. Guys,

 I'm not too late, am I? No, you're just in time. Oh,

 yeah. Okay. Here's the plan. Once the Mayor begins his speech, I'll

 give the signal. That's when we all begin chanting, okay? You got

 it? All right. Let's go. NEIGHBOR 1: Okay. NEIGHBOR 2: All right.

 We need to talk. Now. Quite a turnout. Look at those news

 cameras. Do I need a little base? Hi-def is killing me. Where

 did all these people come from? I don't know. But it looks

 like things are about to get very interesting. No, no, no. How

 did she find out? You told her. The other night. Oh! Well,

 we were drinking... You were drinking. She was listening. Oh, my God.

 Yeah. This is bad. What else did you say to her? I

 mean, she thinks that you still have feelings for me. (SCOFFS) Well,

 that's just ridiculous. She's not gonna say anything to Lynette, is she?

 No. Does she want you to tell Lynette? No. She had a

 different suggestion. And I think it's a good one. I'm going outside

 to watch the protest. Stay in your room and look after your

 sister. Oh! And don't get into those cookies I made. Those are

 for after supper, and yes, I counted them. Juanita, what's wrong? What

 is that? The letter you wrote to Grace. Okay. Okay. Honey, you

 really shouldn't have read this. Because it doesn't mean anything. Grace is

 your daughter, isn't she? That's why you've been crying since she left.

 You love her more than me. No! No, no, no. That is

 not true. You are the most important thing in this world to

 me. You believe Mommy, don't you? You're not my mommy. Juanita, come

 back here! Juanita! Juanita! (GASPS) Juanita! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

 Mayor Harold Franklin! (SUPPORTERS CHEERING) Okay, now. - Save our street! Save

 our street! - Save our street! Save our street! - Save our

 street! Save our street! - Save our street! Save our street! Good

 afternoon, everybody. It's a pleasure and an honor to be here. I

 thought you said the neighborhood was behind this. Did I? I appear

 to have been wrong. MAYOR: But Fairview's strength is our inventory of

 compassionate, understanding people... If I ever get my hands on Paul Young

 I will kill him. Can we talk about this in the hotel?

 There's a lot of angry people out there. I know. MAYOR: Your

 actions are a blueprint for others to emulate. Save our street! Save

 our street! Save our street! Hey, I talked to Tom. This is

 not the time to discuss this. Save our street! Hey, we are

 discussing it! Tom told me about your little suggestion that I need

 to move off the Lane. And I want you to know that

 ain't gonna happen. You know, if you were really Lynette's friend, you

 would know that you cannot live two doors down from her husband,

 a man you still love. That is none of your damn business.

 Really? 'Cause I am Lynette's friend, and I'm not gonna stand by

 and watch you screw up her marriage. So help me, Susan! Hey,

 get your hands off me! Save our street! Save our street! MAYOR:

 Thanks to you, they stand on the cusp of a new life.

 I had to park three blocks away. It's crazy out here. Did

 you finish up everything? Oh, yeah. I'm done. Hey, I got your

 message. What's wrong? I think you should know there's been an incident

 with your father. - Save our street! - Save our street! In

 particular, there is one man, Paul Young... (ALL BOOING) Though he was

 unfairly incarcerated, he has chosen to give Fairview a second chance... Carlos!

 I can't find Juanita. You let her outside with all this going

 on? She ran away. She found out about Grace. How? Look, I'll

 tell you later. Just help me find her. (SIGHS) Juanita! Juanita, where

 are you? Juanita! Juanita! LEE: Can't I go back and get it?

 It's not that important, Lee. She signed that program after her concert

 at Carnegie Hall. She was a drug addict. Let it go. (HONKING)

 Can you move, please? Come on! You son of a bitch. Come

 here. Keith. Look... Hey. - What's wrong with you? - Look, I

 made a mistake, okay? Keith, don't push me. Hey, one of those

 cons is beating up a guy. Get him! - Keith, what are

 you doing? - Come on. Get up. (CONTINUES CHANTING) Through his generosity

 he has chosen not to be angry or bitter... KEITH: Get off

 me. - Get off of him. - Lady... ... helping the men

 who were once his prison mates. And I'm honored to present this

 medallion to a man... (PEOPLE BOOING) And in conclusion, \"Love thy neighbor.\"

 Susan, listen to me! If you don't care about my life, think

 about what you're doing to Lynette! I am thinking about Lynette. This

 would destroy her. Get off of him! (CHANTING STOPS) (ALL SCREAMING) SUSAN:

 Stop pushing! Juanita! Ow! SUSAN: You're pushing. Susan. SUSAN: Stop pushing! Susan!

 MAN: Stop pushing! RENEE: Susan! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) No... Please... (HONKING) Go around

 them. Go around. I can't. There's people everywhere. Maybe we should go

 back in the house. JUANITA: Please don't leave me. Hey! Hey! Brent,

 wait, wait! What the hell are you doing? I'm gonna make sure

 this halfway house never opens. - Oh, my God! - This is

 what you want, isn't it? No. Not like this. Give me the

 bat. - All right, then, you know what? - Wait. You can

 go hang out with the other kiddies. Wait! Brent! Brent! Lynette! Lynette!

 - Help me, please. - Mrs. McCluskey! Oh, my God. I've got

 you. I got you. Just drive. They'll move. Watch it, man! Hey,

 it's them! The one's that sold! Oh, crap! Get them! Get them!

 Get them! (WHIMPERING) Renee! Renee, get off of there! I'm looking for

 Susan. It's not safe! Get down! I saw her fall, I think

 she's hurt! (WHIMPERING) Get out of the car! Now! LEE: It's gonna

 be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

 It's gonna be okay. Help! Help! Juanita! Mommy! Get off! Get off

 this car! Give her to me. Give her to me! - Mommy!

 - Come here, sweetheart. Come here. Get off. Get back. Get off,

 man. LYNETTE: Paul! Paul! Go inside, darling. This is all on you.

 I hope you know that. Me? Those are your friends out there,

 Lynette. The solid citizens of Fairview. Tell me again why you think

 they are better than a bunch of ex-cons. MAN: Get him! Ow!

 Lee! Hey! Stop! Stop it! Leave him alone, leave him alone! Stop!

 He's my neighbor! Stop it. Take him over. Get him over here.

 Come on! (SIRENS WAILING) Somebody help! (INAUDIBLE) Thank you. MARY ALICE: It

 was just before sunrise on Wisteria Lane. You could no longer hear

 the screams of frightened bystanders, or the angry chanting of protestors, or

 the cries for help from the injured. There were just the footsteps

 of a man who had finally punished those who had betrayed him.

 The silence was broken, by something the neighbors would later say (GUNSHOT)

 Sounded like a gunshot. But Paul knew it was the sound of
