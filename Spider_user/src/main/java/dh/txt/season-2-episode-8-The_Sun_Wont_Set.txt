 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: I'm gonna be a stay-at-home dad. Some reversed roles.

 - I've been thinking about you. - You came to ask me

 out? - Some were welcomed in. - I'll say \"yes.\" I've moved

 on. You should do the same. Some were shown the door. Will

 you marry me? And some... ...never got the chance... ...to find out

 what they really wanted. Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman. Everyone had

 always said so, ever since she was a child. Her first piano

 teacher praised her dexterity. Her first college professor applauded her sense of

 rhythm. Her first symphony conductor hailed her dramatic flair. But Betty was

 no longer a concert pianist. She was now just a woman with

 a secret, one she was determined to keep by any means necessary.

 I'm not a bit surprised that somebody broke into Gabrielle's house. Wisteria

 Lane is an easy target. It's not like the police patrol around

 here. - We still have the Neighbourhood Watch. - The Neighbourhood Watch

 is a joke! When was the last time any of you went

 on patrol, huh? Now, I put security lights on my house. I

 say it's time that we hired professional security. That sounds expensive. Could

 you put a price on your kids' safety? You probably could. Look,

 I am as worried as everybody else in this neighbourhood... - We've

 got to stop this. - Say what? \"We're against security\"? - But

 if they find Caleb first... - Hush, I'm trying to think. ...I'm

 talking about trained men who know when to shoot. Do we really

 need professional security? Wait until somebody else is attacked? I think it's

 time to take a vote on armed security. I've had enough. All

 those in favour... Sorry. Things were just getting so dramatic. - Wow,

 you're really good. - We were taking a vote here. She was

 a concert pianist. Well, I dabbled a bit. Yes, Betty Applewhite was

 a gifted woman, and the greatest of all her gifts... ...was her

 timing. Once they've suffered a miscarriage, some women sit alone in the

 dark for hours. They refuse to go out in the light of

 day, afraid to face the possibility that life will go on. They

 hold on to reminders of their unborn child, and dream of what

 might have been. Yes, this is how some women react when they've

 suffered such a loss. Gabrielle Solis was not one of those women.

 Hi, guys! - Hi, honey, how are you? - Hi. I'm fine.

 Thank you for the messages. I'm sorry I haven't had time to

 return calls. We cleared our schedules. We thought you could use company.

 So we're gonna go to my house. I made banana bread, and

 we'll put on a fresh pot and just talk about... anything. That

 sounds so nice. It's just I'm booked solid today, my head's gonna

 explode. Can I take a rain cheque? Sure. Thanks. Thanks for understanding.

 OK, I will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time

 later in the week. Tell you what, since my schedule seems to

 be the problem, why don't I just figure out a time and

 call you? OK. I just... I have so many errands to run,

 and a million things to return. Oh, honey, there's no reason why

 you and Carlos can't try again. You'd be an amazing mother. You

 should hold on to that stuff for awhile. Yeah, you know, I

 would, but the store has this strict 30-day return policy. Carlos, what

 happened? I've had a rough couple days. After you told me about

 the... ...the baby... ...I kind of lost it. Carlos, your hands... -

 I ripped my mattress open. - Jeez, how are you feeling today?

 They're injecting me with this tranquillizer thing. I think it's doing the

 trick. We never even talked about names. I had my top five

 all picked out. - Honey... - You wanna hear them? No, I'm

 good. You never thought about names? Oh, well, it was a little

 soon for that, don't you think? I mean, how can you name

 something the size of a walnut? Is this new? Do you like

 it? I picked it up on the way here. You just lost

 a baby. We all grieve differently. You seem to be taking it

 pretty well. I go shopping. You rip toilets out of the wall.

 Different strokes. Are you even sad? - Oh, please. What do you

 think? - Honestly? I don't know. Of course I'm sad! It's a

 sad situation! Now let go of me! - Oh, man... - Honey,

 are you OK? I think my tranquillizer's wearing off. Well, let's get

 you another round. Come on. Hey, Mike. My mom's wedding's in a

 couple of days, and you sent back that card saying you were

 coming, and that you preferred beef, which I changed to fish for

 you, 'cause I tasted the beef. Anyways, I know that was before

 we, you know... I sent your mom my apologies, but I won't

 be attending. I hope that's not just because of us not being

 \"us\" anymore. I mean, we could be together at a wedding, and

 it wouldn't have to be weird. It'd be weird. Of course. Yeah,

 I see that. So, what have you been doing lately? Oh, just

 the usual. Well, I've been writing a book. Sort of autobiographical. It's

 really been forcing me to re-examine some of the different things that

 have made me \"me.\" Like the fact that my mother had me

 so young, and I never knew my dad. Big stuff, like that.

 I told you about my dad, right? He was a merchant marine,

 and his platoon was killed in the battle of Hanoi. - That's

 strange. - Why? Hanoi was in enemy territory. There wasn't a battle

 there. Are you sure? That's what my mom said. I'm pretty sure,

 yeah. And merchant marines don't fight, they deliver supplies on ships. Well,

 clearly I have more research to do. So, what do you think?

 My life story, would you rush out and buy a copy? -

 Susan? - Yeah? You really need to step back. Yeah! I want

 to be quarterback! Porter? Preston? What have I told you about playing

 outside after dark? It's not dark. Does your dad know you're out

 here? Don't worry. I've been watching them. They keep setting off my

 motion sensors. I ought to send you half my electric bill. You

 do that. OK, guys, come on over here. On the sidewalk. Stay

 there, not on the street. Thank you. Hey. - Hi, babe. -

 I'm home. Could you come here a sec? Sure. What's up? Block

 me, come on! Damn, they must have snuck out again. Again? How

 often does this happen? Boys, get in here. Now! You know how

 slippery they are. - It's like trying to herd cats. - Tom,

 it's 9.00 at night. Guys, upstairs, now! Let's go! Into p.j.'s, into

 bed. Honey, they're fine. You just... You worry too much. And for

 good reason. Someone could have driven off with them, you wouldn't have

 noticed. They were in the front yard. I used to hop on

 my bike, disappear for hours. My mom never batted an eye. That

 was a different time. You have to be vigilant. There was a

 break-in on this street. I was at the Neighbourhood Watch meeting. Sorry.

 I've been doing this for seven years. Trust me. You have to

 have eyes in the back of your head. The two in front

 work just fine, thanks. Really? Where's Penny? See? Right where I left

 her. - How did this get in the paper? - I was

 going to call you... We discussed this. We agreed to go slowly.

 I was going to call and cancel after our talk, but things

 just got so hectic, I forgot. Rex has only been dead for

 seven weeks. - So? - I don't want every woman in this

 town - talking about me behind my back. - I'm sorry, but

 isn't the damage done? Fortunately, people only read the announcements when there's

 nothing on the front page. And the headline today was about some

 catastrophic flood in Sri Lanka. - Oh, so we lucked out. -

 Yes, we did. Now when the time comes to go public with

 our relationship, I need you to discuss it with me first. I'm

 the bride, after all. It's only... appropriate. OK. I will need you

 to wear that ring, though. The ring? You're not wearing it. Where

 is it? - It's in my purse. - Good. Please put it

 on. But if people see it... They'll assume you're wearing your wedding

 ring. - Maybe. But why risk it? - Because a ring tells

 would-be suitors a woman is spoken for. A naked hand invites unwanted

 attention. Here. Let me. Will that be all, Mrs Van De Kamp?

 Yes, I think so, Mr Williams. Hi. Oh, my God! What do

 you want? Hey, it's cool. No, it's not cool! Who the hell

 are you? - Carlos sent me. - I'm gonna call the police!

 Name's Hector. I met Carlos inside. Inside what? You mean in prison?

 He told me what happened. Asked me to come by and keep

 an eye on you. Can I come in? No! No, you can't

 come in! - I brought a cooler. I'll camp here. - No.

 I can take care of myself. OK? OK. OK? Yeah, I get

 it. You need your space. Yes. Yes, I do, I need my

 space. Thank you. - I wanna show you something. - OK. -

 Come here. - Hi, guys. I thought about what you said. Don't

 want you to worry, so I had a little talk with the

 boys. OK, guys. What do we do if a stranger asks us

 to take a ride in their car? - Porter? - We run

 away and call 911. Good man. Right, but what if that stranger

 says, \"Hey, I know your Mommy and Daddy\"? - What, Preston? -

 Still run away. Yes! OK... Can I ask a question? Yeah, by

 all means. What if the stranger is nice and not scary? Yes?

 Run away and call 911. So, what if the stranger says they're

 gonna take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides? Don't

 look at your dad! Eyes on me. What are you gonna do?

 What are you gonna do? - We... - Run away? Yes! Snap!

 OK, to the kitchen! We're having ice cream tonight! You're smiling like

 that meant something. Come on! We worked on this all afternoon. They

 get it. Give me a break. You know our kids. I love

 them dearly, but that goes in one ear and out the other.

 - I'm gonna have some ice cream. - You're not off the

 hook here. Lynette, I can keep my children alive. When you left,

 there were four. When you came home, there were still four. When

 you come home and there are three, then you get to lecture

 me. Excuse me. Are you Bree Van De Kamp? Yes, I am.

 My name is Leila Mitzman. I hope I'm not interrupting. Can I

 help you? This may sound odd, but I felt I should see

 you. I read in the paper that you're engaged to George Williams.

 Oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature. But you and George

 are involved? In a romantic relationship? - Yes. - Then we need

 to talk. We'd been dating for six months when he asked me

 to marry him. From the moment I said yes, George got so

 possessive. And when he found out my ex lived just down the

 street, George accused me of seeing him behind his back. And then

 one night I got a call from the police. Someone had set

 my ex's car on fire. I could never prove anything, but I

 knew it was George. I left him the next day. Well, I

 don't know what to say. I know. It's upsetting. Yes, it is.

 To have a complete stranger come into my home, drink my tea

 and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men

 I've ever known... Honey, you gotta trust me. George is a whack-job.

 And you should get, while the getting's good. I think it's time

 for you to leave. One time I was talking to a guy

 at a bar, and when we got home, George slapped me. What

 do you say to that? Given your overall demeanour and your freewheeling

 use of epithets, I'm willing to bet that he was provoked. When

 I read that you were engaged to George, I felt it was

 my duty to let you know he's crazy. But now that I've

 met you, I can see it's a match made in heaven. I'm

 here! Hi, Morty! Reverend Hopkins. I'm sorry I'm late to your rehearsal.

 It's OK, it's all right. You're here now. It's fine. Go in

 front of me. OK, reverend! Hit it! Mom, can I ask you

 a question? You've got to march, Susie. You've gotta march. I was

 just researching my book and I found the strangest thing. No one

 with my father's name was ever a merchant marine. Did I say

 merchant? I just meant the regular Marines. I thought you probably did,

 so I checked that too, and he wasn't there. So I called

 the VA, and there's not a single record of anyone named Harrison

 Ross in Vietnam. This is not the time, Susie. What's? What's the

 holdup, ladies? I'm sorry to upset you, Mom, I just... Don't you

 think that's weird? What's? What's weird? Well, there's no record of anyone

 with my dad's name in the armed services. There it is. There

 what is? Morty, just go on back up there! Look, I'm not

 gonna say that I knew this would happen. But... I knew this

 would happen. Mom, I need answers. Do you have to do this

 now? You are ruining my wedding rehearsal! You've been married four times.

 You got it. I will not stand here and be attacked. Mom,

 don't walk away from me! What do you want me to say?

 You want me to say I'm a bad mother? Fine! I'm a

 bad mother! Are you happy now? Mom! Mom! Yes, yes, I know

 what I'm getting into. Morty? Morty, have you seen my mom? Yeah.

 Yeah, she seemed... She seemed pretty upset. I think... I think she

 took a cab home. You need? You need a ride? I need

 you to tell me the truth about my father. Hop in. When

 I was in Korea, I was stationed outside of Pusan. And we'd

 get these... these passes, and we'd to go into town, and, you

 know, we'd have a few beers. We used to call it \"R

 and R\" in military lingo. I know what R and R means.

 What does it have to do with my father? Well, that's what

 I'm getting to. Anyway, there were these young ladies, professional ladies if

 you know what I mean. Morty. Can we just move this along?

 OK. Long story short, I... It's just I never figured that my

 first time with a woman would be in an alley behind a

 Korean noodle stand with my fatigues down around my ankles. OK, again,

 what does this have to do with my father? We've... We've all

 done things that, you know, that we're ashamed of. We all... We

 all have secrets. Your father wasn't a war hero. And he... He

 wasn't in Vietnam. Why would my mother tell me that? Sophie wasn't

 married to your father. I'm not sure she even knew his name.

 Are you saying that I am the result of my mother having

 a one-night stand? Well, like I said, we've all... You know, we've

 all done things that we're ashamed of. - George. - Bree! This

 is a surprise. I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but I just

 had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours. A Leila

 Mitzman? She shouldn't have contacted you. Well, she did. And she said

 some pretty horrible things about you. - She's a renowned liar. -

 That's what I thought at first. But then having had time to

 think about it, I can't understand why she'd go to so much

 trouble. I mean, what would her motive be? She's obsessed with me.

 She still wants me. Wasn't it obvious? No. The woman is absolutely

 certifiable. What's more, I can prove it. Leila was a customer here.

 Even though she's no longer welcome, we still keep her prescriptions on

 file. \"Fluoxetine, 100 milligrams. Risperidone 250 mill...\" I'm sorry. What is this?

 One is an anti-depressant for mood swings. One is an anti-psychotic to

 control hallucinations. Like I said, she's a very troubled lady. Well, why

 did you date her in the first place? In the beginning you're

 blind to the flaws. Right? That's true. In the beginning. So, we're

 good? Yeah, of course we are. Your mail came. - You said

 you were leaving! - No, I said I was giving you space.

 I did. I was watching you from my car. Look, the guy

 who broke in stole ice cream. I don't think I'm in any

 danger. So you can go. I don't need you. Carlos says you

 do. - Where you going? - Shopping. - Not that it's any

 of your business. - You sure like to shop. Yes, I do.

 It's all I've seen you do the past day and a half.

 All that shopping must be making up for something. Excuse me? You

 know, Carlos has your number. He says you're one tough cookie. So

 tough, you don't have to deal with your feelings. He's a perceptive

 man. He thought I was cheating with gay guys. You sure you

 wanna go with \"perceptive\"? Let's see. It's been what, a week since

 you lost your baby? Yeah. So? So I've never heard of shopping

 out the pain. Why is everyone on my back about this? I

 will deal with my loss, my way, OK? Where are you going?

 I... I just thought I'd go out and look some more. -

 I'm gonna try the park. - In the middle of the night?

 He hasn't really been showing his face in the daylight, has he?

 Or would you rather we just let Caleb run loose? He could

 be in trouble. Or hurting another girl. He didn't hurt Mrs Solis,

 Matthew. He was just hungry. Yeah, well, I wasn't talking about Mrs

 Solis, but you know that. So, you're still gonna be my matron

 of honour? Of course I am. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm

 not still a little freaked out. I am. But I did a

 lot of thinking about it this morning, and I think I understand.

 You wanted to protect me. And you thought I needed a hero.

 I had one: You. I was always so worried I would screw

 you up. Well, I am screwed up, but it wasn't your fault...

 entirely. Hey, Stu. You busy? Just updating my blog. Because I've got

 an important assignment for you. Great. I'm really ready to take on

 more responsibility around here. Yeah, I applaud that. But what I need

 is for you to help me to prove a point to my

 husband. You wanna make him jealous? No. Actually... ...I need you to

 kidnap my children. Stop hitting me! OK, so what am I supposed

 to be looking at? Just wait for it. OK, here he comes.

 What's going on? I'm just trying to prove a point. Hi... little

 boys. Hell... Who is that? It's just Stu from our office. You

 guys wanna go for a ride? And is he abducting our kids?

 - Maybe. - This is crazy. Why? Are you worried they might

 get in? We can go to the... carnival. You like carnivals? We're

 not allowed to talk to strangers. Run, boys. So why don't you

 boys get in the car? - Run away. Run. - Get in

 the car. I'll give you candy. - Yeah, candy! - Why aren't

 they running away? Well... This is not the time to be smug.

 Clearly our sons are... idiots. OK, OK. Jeez. Everyone share. - Hi.

 - Hi. Oh, my God! Run, kids! Run! Run! Oh, no, you

 don't! You pervert! Oh, no, you're not going anywhere! Anyway, after we

 wrap this shindig, I'm whisking my new bride away on a four-month

 cruise around the world. I would've been happy with a weekend in

 Vegas, but, you know. Anyway, here she is, my beautiful bride. I

 want to thank everyone for coming, and especially my Morty, who's helped

 me to be a better person. And I want to thank... ...my

 amazing daughter, Susan, and tell her how much I appreciate her love

 and respect. Because I'm a horrible person! And she deserves so much

 better than me! - Honey, honey... - No, no, no, no, no!

 Susie needs to know the truth. Your father... ...was not a one-night

 stand. He was 33. And he was married. And he was my

 boss. When I told him I was pregnant, he broke it off

 and he never spoke to me again. But he gave me my

 beautiful, incredible daughter. And for that, I want to thank Addison Prudy.

 Oh, my God! Do you know where he is? I have no

 idea. I swear. If I knew, I would tell you. I know

 Addison Prudy. He runs the feed and supply store at Third and

 Sutherland. Prudy's a fairly common name, of co... So... Is that him?

 Yes. Are you saying that all this time, my father's been alive

 and just right across town running the supply and feed store? -

 Susie... - I can't believe this! You're not... You're not still seeing

 him, are you? Is something wrong? You've been so quiet all evening.

 No, no, I'm just tired, that's all. Care to dance? It might

 pep you up. I don't think so. But thank you, though. Bree,

 where is your ring? Oh, the stone is loose, so I'm gonna

 take it to the jewellers. But don't worry. It's safe. This isn't

 about Leila, is it? No, no, it's like I told you. The

 stone could just pop off at any second. Well, I don't care.

 Please put it on. - What? - I want you to wear

 it. - Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to. - Why

 not? Because I don't feel like it. And this is the last

 time we're gonna talk about this. OK? Excuse me, ma'am, we don't

 allow members of Zeta Beta Kappa in here. Ty! Ty Grant! Hi!

 What are you doing in town? - Visiting my folks. - Oh,

 my goodness! Oh, George, this is Ty Grant. We used to date

 in college. Ty, this is George. He's a good friend of mine.

 - Hi. - Actually, we're engaged. Bree, you look fantastic. You haven't

 aged a day... Ty, would you like to dance? Sure. I'd love

 to. Let me take your coat. I need to cut in. George,

 would you please sit down? You're being rude. - Am I in

 the middle of something? - Put on the ring. - No. -

 Oh, boy. - George, I don't want to! - We are engaged!

 You have to wear it! - George, stop it! - Hey, knock

 it off! I'm sorry. I just... We're engaged. See, the thing is,

 I don't think we are anymore. Bree... Please, you should go. Listen,

 Bree... Hi. Right over there. Management likes us to keep the nice

 cars out front. Afternoon. New hairdo? So, what if it is? Looks

 nice, that's all. I also got a facial, and later on I'm

 gonna get a pedicure - and an eyebrow wax. So there. -

 That's fine with me. It's not. I know what you're thinking. -

 Yeah? - You know what? I'm tired of you judging me. What

 is it gonna take to get rid of you? - What's your

 last name? - Ramos. Ramos. Here is $1000. I won't tell Carlos

 you didn't stick around. It'll be our little secret. I just got

 out of prison. I'm not exactly set up with a bank account.

 Can we go to your bank and cash this? And then you'll

 leave? Hey, it's a grand. Buckle up. You don't have a window

 thingie. Nope. You don't have a door handle either. Nope. But I

 do have a confession to make. Carlos didn't really send me to

 protect you. Go figure. No one else in the park. We got

 it all to ourselves. Perfect. Why don't you go find us a

 good spot? I gotta get something out of the trunk. Hey! Where

 the hell are you going? You're not gonna kill me? I hadn't

 planned on it. Besides, if I was gonna kill you, I wouldn't

 use a balloon. - It would take too long. - What am

 I supposed to think? You lie about protecting me, then lock me

 in that heap without door handles so I can't get out! Carlos

 sent me to help you with your grief. - You're kidding, right?

 - No! Look, I know a little something about loss. It can

 take you to some real dark places. Especially if you don't face

 it head-on. Like 17 years in a six-by-ten prison cell. Dark. What's

 this for? The balloon represents the spirit of the life lost. By

 letting it go, you're acknowledging the pain you feel, and releasing it

 at the same time. OK, that's ridiculous. Besides, I don't feel what

 you think I'm feeling. Then it should be real easy. - Fine.

 If I do this, will you go? - Yeah. OK. Should I

 say something? If you want to. - Not really, no. - That's

 cool. Any time. This is stupid. I didn't even want this baby.

 Yeah. And I would've been a terrible mother. If you say so.

 If it was a boy, I was gonna name it Charlie. Yeah?

 And a girl, Aurora. Those are nice names. Thank you. What is

 it, boy? - What's going on out here? - Call the police.

 - You need me to zap him? - Just call the police.

 Is that the guy who broke into your house? I don't know,

 I can't see him. Yeah, that's him. In a world filled with

 darkness, we all need some kind of light. Whether it's a great

 flame that shows us how to win back what we've lost, or

 a powerful beacon intended to scare away potential monsters. Or a few

 glowing bulbs that reveal to us the hidden truth of our past.

 We all need something to help us get through the night. Even
