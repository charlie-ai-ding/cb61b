 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... There was flirtation. Here's my card. If you see

 anything suspicious, I want you to call me... - or even if

 you don't. - There was confrontation. After all those years that I

 supported you, took a backseat to your career, you couldn't do the

 same for me. - Oh! Aah! - There was a fight. Leave

 me alone! And... there were consequences. Susan Delfino was charitable to a

 fault. She just couldn't resist lending a hand. There wasn't a lost

 pet she could ignore... A girl in uniform she could refuse... Or

 a struggling artist she could say no to. So when it came

 to a neighbor in need... Oh, my god. Paul, what happened? Susan

 was only too eager to help. I started having chest pains, Passed

 out, came to, dialed 9-1-1. They've been running tests all night. Well,

 I'm gonna be here for you till they figure it out. I

 brought you these-- magazines, water. You're unbelievable. I've got a street full

 of neighbors, And the only one who comes to see me is

 the woman I yelled at. - Sorry about that. - It was

 my fault. I shouldn't have asked you about getting my house back.

 I sounded like a vulture. Mr... Young, we've got your test results.

 Could you excuse us for a moment, Susan? Oh, yeah. I'll wait

 outside. Well, good news. Your E.K.G. came back normal. - So it's

 not a heart attack? - It's not a heart attack. Says here

 you've been experiencing dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps. That's right. What do you

 think it is? I think unless you've been poisoned or you're pregnant,

 it's probably just stress. Poisoned? Yeah. I remember this case when I

 was an intern. A man came in with the same symptoms. Turns

 out his wife was putting antifreeze in his oatmeal. Little bit every

 day so it wasn't obvious. But eventually, it killed him. Good lesson

 for all of us-- don't piss off the old lady. What did

 he say? He thinks it's stress. Just stress? That's a relief. So

 you must be starving. What can I make you for dinner tonight?

 Yes, Susan Delfino just couldn't resist lending a hand to a neighbor

 in trouble. I'm sure anything you bring will be a huge help

 to me. Which was about to cause her some trouble of her

 own. Sync by YYeTs.net Corrected by Addic7ed www.addic7ed.com No matter how secure

 we are, we all experience moments of dread. It may be just

 before we open our credit card bill... or hand over a note

 from our teacher... or step on the scale after a week away

 from the gym. Yes, we all experience moments of dread, and sometimes

 we have no one to blame... but ourselves. Daddy's home. How are

 my-- \"Bloody Stranger 2\"? She can't watch this! Daddy, no! Look, this

 is about some... stranger who comes to town and starts murdering slutty

 teenagers! Yeah. It's a good lesson for when she's older. Don't be

 a slutty teenager. Gaby, this is way too violent. Oh, the kid's

 used to violence. You've seen me make her eat carrots. Besides, Juanita

 knows the movie's fake. Right, honey? Duh. There's no way one speargun

 could shoot through three heads in real life. Exactly. Two, maybe. Maybe.

 Oh, Carlos, relax. Juanita's tough. She'll be fine. Aah! He's out there!

 Oh! Calm down, sweetie. Who's out there? The bloody stranger. He was

 standing on our lawn looking at our house. The bloody stranger. Nice.

 No, honey, we talked about this, remember? How it was all pretend?

 Can I sleep in here with you guys? You can sleep with

 her. I'm gonna sleep in your bed. Celia's in my bed. Then

 I'll sleep in Celia's bed. She wet her bed. Come on in.

 - Hey! - Hey! Look who's home in time for dinner! Yeah,

 well, I couldn't miss spaghetti night. Spaghetti night's tuesday, dad. - You

 made it home for taco night. - Taco night? Ay, caramba! Hey--no.

 I'm kidding. Mwah. Hey, your mom made a lovely dinner, so the

 least that I could do was bring home dessert. - Plane tickets?

 - That's right. - I planned the family vacation this year. -

 You did what? Seven days, six nights at the Royal Kailua spa

 and resort In... Hawaii. - Whoo! - Dad! - Well done, sir!

 - I've never been there! You bought the tickets without talking to

 me first? Okay. Not exactly \"wow, Tom, you're the greatest husband in

 the world.\" But I told you, I already planned our vacation, Just

 like I've been doing for the last 16 years. Well, there you

 go. You deserve a year off. Wait until you see - the

 waterslides at this place. - Cool! Yeah. Yeah, cool. Except I just

 spent two weeks mapping out a route for a camping trip, -

 And I put a deposit down on an R.V. - Okay, so

 we eat the deposit. Wish I could eat it right now. And

 I told my sister we'd stop by and visit on the way.

 We get back from Hawaii, we fly her out to see us

 here-- Boom! Problem solved. And yet still no \"You're the greatest husband

 in the world\"? Oh, my god. First class? You are the greatest

 husband in the world! Aah! Oh, my god! We're going to Hawaii!

 Aah! Yes! So lucky! Ohh. Yeah. Hawaii. Principal Hobson! Principal Hobson? Principal

 Hobson! Uh-- Susan! Hey! Great to see you! Did you get my

 e-mails? I sent you, like, ten. E-mails? No. - Oh. Well, in

 the first one-- - All right. I got them. And I would

 be glad to give you your job back, - but I'm afraid

 it just isn't gonna happen. - Oh... Why not? Susan, you can't

 be surprised that there are consequences when you show up on the

 internet holding a feather duster and wearing a purple bra? That was

 very specific. Well, I-I had to verify the claims in order to--

 My point is, the damage was done. I know. I made a

 mistake. But I feel like I deserve a second chance. If it

 were up to me, I would give you that chance. But you

 know private schools. The parents' council has all the power. So... if

 I were to win them over... Well, it would be a start.

 Thank you. I'll take it from here. Oh, and I promise, No

 feather duster, no purple bra. And no black bustier. Nice talking to

 you. Oh, Detective Vance. I was just, um, heading out. I won't

 keep you. I just stopped by to give you another card, -

 to replace the one you lost. - What makes you think I

 lost it? I gave it to you two days ago. You never

 called me, - So I'm assuming you lost it. - No. I

 didn't. Now, is that nice? I give you a graceful way to

 spare my feelings, and you clobber me with facts. You sure you

 didn't lose it? Quite sure. In fact, it's right here in my

 purse. You didn't throw it away. That must mean you were thinking

 of calling. Look... this is my second try. I can't ask you

 again. - Is that an ultimatum? - It's a fact of courtship--

 Twice is charmingly persistent. Once more and I'm stalking you. - So

 you're courting me? - I'm trying to. When will you stop playing

 hard to get? Maybe when you stop playing hard to want. -

 You see how much you enjoy smacking me down? - Mm. Why

 pass up a chance to do it all night? Come on. One

 dinner. Fine. This thursday, 8:00 P.M. Great. See you then. I thought

 you were heading out. Right. You... want me to test a tuna

 noodle casserole? Is that a problem? Well, normally we test stuff like

 soil samples and ground water, But sure, I can do it. What

 are you looking for? Antifreeze. Hey. What are you doing tonight? A

 friend of mine's playing at a jazz club. Oh, thanks, Renee, but

 I have a date. If you don't want to come, just say

 so. - You don't have to make stuff up. - No! I

 really do have a date. - Is that so hard to believe?

 - Uh, slightly. So who is he? He's a detective. His name

 is Chuck. Chuck Vance. Well, don't stop. I want to hear it

 all. Actually, that's all I know. That's it? And you agreed to

 go out with him? I never date a guy until I've done

 a complete background check. - Maybe I should just google him. -

 Amateur. Give me his name and I will find out everything worth

 knowing-- Marital history, net worth, results of his last physical. The physical

 seems excessive. That's what I thought till I spent a weekend pinned

 under a dead linebacker. Why would you let her watch something called

 \"Bloody Stranger 2\"? I know, I know. I'm an idiot. Now she's

 having nightmares And crawling into our bed every night. When I was

 a kid, I had bad dreams like you wouldn't believe-- jumping-out-of-bed, running-down-the-hall-screaming

 kind of dreams. - So what'd you do? - Guess I outgrew

 'em. You did? Juanita, come here! - What are you doing? -

 I figured you could talk to her. You know, give her one

 of those \"it gets better\" speeches you gays love so much. Sweetie,

 Lee wants to talk to you. So your mom says you've been

 having nightmares. What are they about? I see this creepy guy standing

 on our lawn. Oh, you poor thing. You know, when I was

 little, I had nightmares, too. - Really? - Yeah. My brother told

 me that there was a hospital for the criminally insane on the

 outskirts of town. And at night, the inmates would escape and kidnap

 little boys and girls. But it's not real. His brother was just

 trying to scare him. Oh, no. It was totally real. One summer,

 three kids went missing. - Until they found them... - Right. About

 a month later... in a ravine. Alive! No. Come on. They were

 in a ravine. What good ever comes out of a ravine? What

 the hell was that? I'm just showing her there's nothing to be

 frightened of. My story's way scarier than hers. Okay. So Cindy's in

 charge of decorations, Abby, you're handling music... Oh, sorry. Sorry. Don't let

 me interrupt. Susan, what are you doing here? I heard you guys

 were planning an open house night, and I'd love to pitch in.

 How can I help? Let's see. You're legendary for your cleaning abilities.

 That didn't take long. Do you need any refreshments? I could make

 something. Thanks, but if we need any help, we'll call you. Is

 it still 99 cents a minute? Okay, uh... looks like we should

 just get this out there. My family had a really crappy year.

 Uh, I did some things that I am not proud of. But

 I was a damn good teacher when I was at this school.

 And I was hoping that you ladies might eventually support hiring me

 back. You want to teach here again? I think the parents' council

 might have a big problem with that. Look, I-I'm not asking for

 your forgiveness-- just a chance to earn it. Let me do something

 for open house. I really do wanna help. Okay. How about you

 pick up the streamers? Streamers? If you can handle it. Just be

 careful not to confuse them with tassels. Meeting adjourned. I shouldn't even

 look at this. It feels like such an intrusion. And besides, he'll

 be here any minute. Then I'm just in the nick of time.

 You found something bad? Well, for me, his salary alone makes him

 a non-starter. But you may be more interested in what's on page

 three. Is he a dirty cop? Or a democrat? Worse. Hello, Chuck.

 I was afraid I was early, but, uh... looks like you're all

 ready. Oh, I'm ready, all right. Shall we? Hope this is okay.

 You like Italian, right? Everybody likes Italian. Oh, it's fine. So let's

 talk. Tell me about yourself. Tell me everything. Okay, what do you

 want to know? Oh, whatever you think is, hmm... pertinent. Okay. Um,

 I was born in Pennsylvania. I played some ball in college. Um,

 I have a degree in criminology. Interesting. Anything else? Well, I have

 two kids. Oh. So you've been married. Yeah. Didn't work out. I

 hope you don't judge me for that. Oh, no. Not for that.

 Is something wrong, Bree? I'm just wondering when you were going to

 tell me that you're still married. I see you've done due diligence.

 Did your source happen to mention that I filed for divorce last

 spring? And that it hasn't gone through, So technically, you're still married.

 - You should have told me. - We haven't even ordered yet.

 You expect me to lead with that? \"Hey, I'm technically married. The

 chicken looks good.\" You shouldn't be dating at all until your divorce

 is final. - What if you and your wife reconcile? - I

 haven't spoken to my wife In a year without my lawyer present.

 You can't blame me for doing a simple background check. Hell, no.

 I'm sure you want to avoid another mistake like your second husband,

 the hit-and-run driver. Orson, was it? What? Tell me, who was creepier--

 him or that pharmacist who killed himself while you were dating? Where

 did you hear that? I pulled your police file. I have a

 file? And you pulled it. How dare you investigate me before our

 date! Say that again, and this time, listen for the irony. There

 is no comparison to what I did. You could have been dangerous!

 I have to protect myself. Oh, women can be dangerous, too, Especially

 ones who own four handguns and a .30-06 hunting rifle. What's up

 with that? This is outrageous. You are treating me like a common

 criminal! What can I get you folks to start? I will not

 be ordering. I want to go home now. Come on, Bree. Calm

 down. Have a drink. I don't drink. Wasn't that in my file?

 Someone's slipping. What are you doing? Hmm? What do you think I'm

 doing? I think you're wasting your time, much as I did when

 I planned this year's vacation. We should have discussed this. I wanted

 to surprise you. I wasn't surprised. I was blindsided. You may call

 all the shots at work, But you're not the C.F.O. of this

 family. Ugh. You're right. For what it's worth, your road trip sounds

 amazing. I just don't think it's gonna pan out for this summer.

 But you made a hell of a great start for next year's

 trip. Don't pull that management trick on me. - What trick? -

 The \"Yes\" sandwich. Start with a compliment, lower the boom, end with

 a compliment. It's the oldest trick in business, - And I taught

 it to you. - Lynette, I already promised Hawaii to the kids.

 You want me to take it away? You saw how excited they

 were. Only because they've never had a lavish vacation before. Give me

 the same budget, and I'll make my trip - Sound twice as

 good as yours. - Oh, I would love to see you try.

 Okay, then. Game on. We'll, um, we'll sit the kids down, We'll

 each make our presentation. Let them decide. Sounds fair to me. Game

 on. Okay. Game on. Uh... Honey. I'm not turned on. You're a

 very handsome man. We're not gonna have sex. That's a \"No\" Sandwich.

 Level with me, Bree. - Do I still have a chance with

 you? - None whatsoever. Then this can't make things any worse. That's

 right. Keep driving, buddy. - Why'd you do that? - Get in,

 Violet. Oh, my god. You couldn't have dropped me off before you

 pick up a prostitute? You arresting me, Chuck? Just taking you to

 the women's shelter. So what is this, your good deed for the

 night? You trying to impress your date? No. That ship has sailed.

 She hates me more than you do. Why? What's wrong with him?

 My opinion isn't any of your concern, miss. You're better off without

 her, Chuck. This one's got a stick up her ass. And what

 qualifies you to make such snap judgments - about people you've just

 met? - I'm a hooker. It's what I do. Here we are,

 and I'm watching to make sure you go in. You know I'm

 just gonna be back on that corner tomorrow. Yeah, well, that's tomorrow's

 problem. When are you gonna give up? What I am now... that's

 all I'm ever gonna be. You think so? Did you know that

 ten years ago, Bree here was turning tricks just like you? How

 dare you. Bree, she needs to hear this. I must have hauled

 her ass in 50 times. Then one day, she said, \"I'm better

 than this.\" She got herself to school. Before you knew it, she

 had a first class catering company, So don't try to tell me

 that you can't make a better life for yourself. You were really

 on the street? Actually, I... I don't like to talk about that

 part of my life. I get it. Look at you now, huh?

 It was really nice to meet you. Likewise. Thank you, Chuck. Don't

 mention it. I know. Way outta line. You said I had no

 chance, so I figured, what the hell. Home? Yes, please. You were

 right. Found trace amounts of antifreeze, but don't worry. Wouldn't have killed

 you. What would happen if I ate one of these casseroles every

 day? Well, for one thing, you'd get tired of tuna casserole. Ahem.

 If you repeatedly consumed ethylene glycol, your heart would start to fail,

 your kidneys would give out. Eventually, you'd die. It'd be a nasty

 way to go. Huh. I can only imagine. What are you doing?

 I thought I was borrowing Lynette's tent. Turns out I borrowed a

 nylon bag of death. Why are you setting up the tent? For

 Juanita. I wanna prove to her there's no scary guy on the

 lawn. I figured if she spends the night camping out here, she'll

 get over it. So the kid is scared there's a killer lurking

 outside at night, and your solution is to make her sleep out

 here? Not alone, you dope. You'll be with her. Me? Yeah. What

 if she's right? What if there is a killer... or it's cold?

 Oh. Forget it. I got an early meeting tomorrow, and I'm not

 going in half asleep Because I slept on my lawn. You caused

 this problem. You fix it, tonight. And stop pouting. It's fun to

 sleep outside. I'm sure it is. That must be why the homeless

 are always so cheery! Come in. Hey. After our date-- or rather,

 non-date-- I was very confused. Makes two of us. I was... offended

 when you didn't tell me the truth about your marriage and oddly

 touched when you told a complete stranger I was a whore. Well,

 if you like that, you should wait till valentine's day. I wanted

 to know your secrets right away, and I didn't want to tell

 you mine until I felt I could trust you, and that... wasn't

 fair. I was no better. When did dating become so complicated? We're

 not kids anymore. We've both had our hearts kicked around. I guess

 it's made us a little gun-shy... If \"gun-shy\" is the right word

 for a woman with an arsenal as big as yours. So what

 do we do? I say... we forget about the crazy digging for

 dirt that we both did and just have a normal first date.

 All right. When? Well, it is lunchtime. Why not? I know this

 little Indian place That does an amazing lamb vindaloo. How'd you know

 I like Indian food? I'd rather not say. I don't even know

 why I wanna work at that school again. Ugh, those smug cliquey

 moms. I mean, can you believe that Dana gave me streamer duty?

 It's positively awful. So tell me, how is Paul? I hear he

 went to the hospital? He thought he was having a heart attack,

 But the test results came back negative. Do the doctors know what

 caused it? They think it's stress, But I'm worried about him. Oh,

 don't be. Well, I think he should go back and have more

 tests done. He'll be fine. As a nurse, I saw time and

 again that the best prescription for stress Is rest and good food.

 So sweet of you to make these cookies for him. Well, yeah,

 I hope it cheers him up. I'm sure it's just what the

 doctor ordered. Well... I wish I could do more. Oh, Susan. You're

 doing more for Paul than you can possibly know. The Grand Canyon.

 Over a mile deep. It took six million years to form. Sequoia

 National Forest-- A soaring monument to nature's majesty. So that's our vacation?

 Looking at trees and a hole in the ground? Now, now, kids,

 your mom worked hard on this. Be kind. Yeah. Yeah, if the

 Grand Canyon isn't your scene... Did she say \"scene\"? You're bound to

 love our next stop... The screaminator. Seven minutes of sheer roller coaster

 terror. \"Responsible parenting\" magazine calls it the worst idea since the caffeinated

 juice box. - That's awesome. - Ooh. - That sounds really... -

 Oh, me likey that. - That's very sweet! - Any and all

 of these thrilling destinations are available to us. We just point the

 R.V... and drive. - All right! - Whoo! - Yes! - Oh,

 man, I can't wait. Ooh, I forget about the R.V. Won't it

 be a little cramped now that we have Paige? Oh, maybe your

 dad's right. Maybe we shouldn't take the R.V. Maybe we should take...

 the Road Juggernaut 8000. State-of-the-art entertainment system, six private sleeping compartments, and

 two full baths, One of which Justin Bieber used on his last

 tour to make... water balloons. - Shut up! - Shut up! -

 I'm blown away right now! - We are going on vacation! Follow

 that, Hawaii. Will you take that off? No. Juanita, you look ridiculous.

 I don't care how I look. - I don't want that killer

 guy to chop off my head. - First of all, a helmet

 wouldn't keep him from chopping off your head. It would just mean

 I'd have to clean it before I gave it back to Parker.

 Second, there is no killer guy. - It's an actor in a

 movie. - But I'm still scared. It's okay to be scared. It's

 even fun sometimes. But you can't let that scared come from inside

 your own head, and you have to be able to calm it

 down if it does. What's that? It's people walking by, juanita. This

 is what I'm talking about. This is where you take charge of

 your fear. Mama, I think it's the killer. No, it's not, Juanita.

 Mom, look! Aah! Oh! Who's out there?! Go away! Gotcha! What the

 hell is wrong with you?! I'm trying to help. By giving me

 a heart attack-- - You thought that would help? - Kinda did.

 Oh, mom, you should've seen your face. I just wanted to show

 you that not everything that looks scary actually is. See? Plastic. It's

 like the movie. It looks scary, but it's fake. Exactly. I have

 to go. Bob's in the shower... and he's about to pay for

 not liking my... chicken pot pie. So when you cast your vote

 tonight, kids, cast it for adventure... luxury, nature. 'cause Hawaii has something

 for every Scavo, whether it is circling a smoking volcano in a

 helicopter or swimming in crystal-clear waters with the dolphins. It is the

 vacation of a lifetime. I didn't wanna do this. You know who

 else loves swimming in those crystal-clear waters? Nature's hungriest predator-- the great

 white shark. Come on. There hasn't been a shark attack on the

 island in forever. Really? Or did they just fail to find the

 evidence? Great whites tend to eat their victims. What? This is very,

 very unlikely to happen. You're right. You're right. I mean, especially if

 we all die first in... a gruesome helicopter crash. Now you see

 why the natives call them death birds. You-- you think you're gonna

 be safer driving across country? Who knows the number one cause of

 accidental death? - Oh, I do. It's the car crash. - Don't

 worry, kids. We're gonna hire a professional driver. It won't be your

 dad. Guys, can we go upstairs and talk about this before we

 vote? You bet. We await your verdict. - Yeah. - Aloha! God,

 you are a hypocrite. How? Ten years ago, Christmas, we are standing

 in the scooter aisle at the toy store when I wanna choose

 the twins' big present. You say, \"Tom, when you start making the

 money, you can start making the decisions.\" You've been sitting on that

 for a decade? Wow. Well, guess what. I make the money-- Big

 money-- more money than you ever did, so I get to decide

 how we spend it! We're supposed to be equal partners. I just

 wanted a say in the process. No, you don't. You wanna control

 the process - Like you always do. - Watch it. And then

 you feel that power slipping away, and you can't stand it. You

 can't stand that I am running the show. Running the show? Are

 you kidding me? We're talking about a family vacation-- Not anymore we

 are not! This is about how you can't handle my success. No,

 you can't handle your success. You've turned into a pompous ass! Maybe

 because it's turned you into a raging bitch. Lee! I am warning

 you. Once was funny. This time, I will kill you. Get out

 of here! How's Penny? Really upset. She kept crying and saying how

 she didn't wanna choose. I don't care where we go. We'll take

 the road trip. Not the vacation, Tom. She doesn't wanna choose which

 one of us to live with. That is awful. Why would she

 think that? Why wouldn't she? She's seen it happen to three of

 her friends. We have always fought, Tom, but never like that. I

 know. It's gotta stop. I agree. I mean, I'm scared to open

 my mouth for fear you're gonna bite my head off. I'm sorry.

 Was that an olive branch? I'm no better, okay? I miss dinner

 four nights a week, and even when I am here... my mind

 is back at the office. I think we're the ones who need

 a vacation. Alone. Yeah. Not a big trip. Just a weekend. We

 can... get a chance to be together and work through all of

 this. You're right. We should do it this weekend. You mean it?

 Yeah. I just have to check with the office. Okay. But we

 are gonna do it, right? You're not gonna get all - busy

 at the last minute? - I said we'll do it, - and

 we'll do it, okay? - Okay. Okay. Hello, Susan. Hey, Dana. I

 got you your streamers. I splurged and bought the good ones-- flame-retardant.

 Good. Oh, my god. Are those cookies for the open house? Oh,

 well, actually-- You are a lifesaver. I just had two moms flake

 out on me. Really? Uh... well... I thought that might happen, so

 I baked some just in case. It's one of the things that

 makes a great teacher-- Being ready for anything. Thank you. You know,

 Susan, I haven't been your biggest supporter, but maybe I misjudged you.

 Thanks for these. Let's find some time to sit down with Principal

 Hobson and talk about you coming back. Yes! Hello, Susan. - Come

 on in. - Meals on wheels. Well, shoes. But \"Food on shoes\"

 doesn't sound as good. Today's special is lasagna. Would you like me

 to put it on a plate for you, or do you wanna

 eat it later? I think I'll have it now. In fact, I'd

 love for you to join me. Oh, I can't. Actually, I'm on

 my way to a function at M.J.'s school. I'm sure you have

 a few minutes. Sit down. Uh... I'm kind of in a rush.

 But it's not fair. You go to all this trouble to bring

 me these delicious meals, and we never share them. - It pains

 me. - Uh... Paul, what's... going on? Fine. You're in a hurry.

 Why don't you stab me with this? It'll be faster. Or are

 you getting your kicks watching me die slowly? Okay, I have no

 idea what you're talking about. The food you're bringing me, Susan. It's

 poisoned. What? That's not possible. I had it tested. Come on. Have

 a bite. Paul. How could you do this to me? Is it

 because you want the house? Is it-- is it because you hate

 me? Okay, you have to believe me. I never put poison in

 your food. Well, somebody did. Was it Mike? No! It was just

 me. I-I'm the only one who... What? Oh, my god. The cookies.

 I-I've gotta go. I've gotta get to the school! Oh, Cindy, Cindy.

 The desserts-- The desserts, my cookies-- have they put them out yet?

 Oh! Yeah. They're... just... I'm so sorry. Try the oatmeal raisin. Kathy,

 um, do you know how many points these are? You'll thank me

 tomorrow. Susan? What did you do to the parents' council? They love

 you. Oh, great! Thanks for the cookie. Uh, which one of these

 is--is mine? Ooh, I have no idea. We just put 'em all

 together. Oh! Whoops! Sorry. Oh, silly me. If I can have everyone's

 attention for a moment, please? Hi. I wanna welcome all our wonderful

 parents. And I wanna thank the decorating committee and those who made

 the refreshments. Oh, including Susan Delfino. Thank you, Susan, for those chocolate

 chip cookies. Oh. Uh... you're welcome. And about those cookies I made--

 don't eat them. They're poison. No, no, this isn't a joke. My

 cookies will kill you. Oh, god. That's her, officers. Yes, no matter

 who we are, we all experience moments of dread... When we ask

 ourselves, will anyone believe I'm innocent? Will my daughter be a child

 of divorce? Will this man break my heart? Are there things that

 go bump in the night? And sometimes... the answer... is yes. Sync
