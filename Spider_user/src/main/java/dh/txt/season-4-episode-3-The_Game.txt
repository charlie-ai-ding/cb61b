 ":"MARY

 ALICE: Previously on Desperate Housewives. Bree discovered a family secret. Oh, I'm

 going to be sick. Lynette struggled with chemotherapy, (LYNETTE VOMITING) while Susan

 took joy in being pregnant. I'm eating for two. The biggest obstacle

 to Carlos and Gabby... The IRS could make me testify against you.

 ... was the promise Edie forced Carlos to make. We're engaged. CARLOS:

 I really did care for Edie, but I can't let her ruin

 my life. KID: Trevor, over here! MARY ALICE: All children love to

 play games. But before they can race their bikes, or jump their

 ropes, or toss their Frisbees, children understand they must first convince their

 friends to play along with them. The same is true for adults.

 Hi, Gabby. It's me. I'm throwing a party Saturday night. Guess what

 kind. A charades party? Didn't you just throw one? No, that was

 a year ago. Oh, right. I guess it's time for another one.

 Sure is. Can you come? Sorry. Victor needs me at this political

 thing. Damn. Damn, damn. You have to come. You're the best charades

 player I know. That's sweet. And totally accurate. But I'm really whipped

 from the chemo, so... (CALL WAITING BEEPS) Oh, there's my other line.

 Can you ask me next time? Okay, hon? Okay. Bye. Hello? Oh,

 hey, Bree, what's up? Well, I stopped by Katherine's last night just

 to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what I overheard. She

 slapped her kid? No! BREE ON PHONE: Yes. And get this. When

 Adam said Dylan was just going to keep asking questions, Katherine said,

 and I quote, \"Well, we're just gonna have to find better lies.\"

 (CALL WAITING BEEPS) Oh, hang on. I've got another call. Don't answer

 it! It's Susan. She's hosting another game night. Another one? It's time

 for an anonymous letter. Wait, is Katherine going to Susan's charade night?

 - Probably. Why? - LYNE TTE: We should go, too. Get a

 few drinks in her, see if she loosens up. I doubt a

 woman like Katherine is gonna spill her secrets just because she's had

 a little wine. I don't know. You came out with some interesting

 things before you swore off the sauce. Well, none that I recall.

 Didn't you tell me you lost your virginity in the backseat of

 a... Point well taken! I'll bring the wine. Susan, good news. We

 can come to the party after all. Hey, you know who else

 you should invite? Yeah, I am feeling much better, so count me

 in. Will our new neighbour be coming? Of course. I love your

 charades parties. And I hope you're inviting that delightful Katherine Mayfair. So,

 you were paid a very nice compliment today. - I was? -

 Yes. I'm hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went

 out of their way to insist I invite you. Really? MARY ALICE:

 Yes, not all adults like to play games. But the ones who

 do, play to win. MARY ALICE: Stella Wingfield hated to cook. Still,

 she spent that Friday morning grating cheese and greasing a pan and

 laying in macaroni because her eldest daughter was sick. And Stella could

 no longer sit by and do nothing. - Lunch time. - Oh,

 no thanks. Oh, come on, I made it for you special. You

 got to keep your strength up. I appreciate the effort, but I

 told you I can't keep anything down. And FYI, mac and cheese

 is halfway to vomit. You might as well have given me a

 plate of creamed corn. Aren't you taking the anti-nausea drug? Yeah, I

 am taking it. It's just not working. Well, I know something that

 might help your nausea and boost your appetite. Perhaps a little visit

 from my old friend, Mary Jane? You're suggesting pot? A lot of

 chemo patients use it. Hell, I did. Come on, let mama score

 you some kick-ass chronic. \"Kick-ass chronic\"? You're a grandmother. Shouldn't you be

 off somewhere knitting an afghan? I'm just trying to ease your pain.

 Well, thanks. But I prefer not to get my medication from some

 guy under a bridge. Suit yourself. Hey, what's this? A crib. Oh,

 and look. Safety latch. I figured if the baby takes after you,

 accident proof is key. Honey, you know, I'm still in my first

 trimester. Don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?

 \"Early\" would be painting it pink or blue. But I got both,

 so we're covered either way. Great. And whether it's a boy or

 a girl... Colts fan. That's non-negotiable. Bree's home. I'll be right back.

 Look sharp. It's Susan. God, it's getting harder and harder to keep

 her at arm's length. I never knew she was such a hugger.

 - You want me to run interference? - No, no. I'm getting

 good at props. Oh, good. - Hey, Susan. What's up? - I

 need a favour. I remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician.

 Can I get his number? - I thought you were using Dr

 Mayfair. - Yeah, I don't know. It's getting a little weird. You

 know, Adam is my neighbour. Well, you don't mind Orson being your

 dentist. Well, that's because I don't blush when Orson says, \"Open wide.\"

 You know, my OB is all the way across town. You just

 do not want to drive that far. Oh, well, we could schedule

 our appointments together and carpool. You know, pregnant gals on the road!

 That does sound fun. But I don't think my doctor's taking on

 any new patients. Oh, I can talk him into it. What's his

 name? I... don't remember. - You don't remember? - No, you know,

 I usually just call him \"doctor.\" Bree, just get me the number.

 (CHUCKLING) Here you go. But please don't mention my name. As I

 said, you know, he's overbooked, and I just don't want to get

 on his bad side. I'm so excited! Pregnant gals, sharing a doctor!

 (SNEEZES) Oh, bless you. Oh, sorry. Probably just allergies. But, you know,

 you don't want to take any chances. Hey, can I get a

 drink? Yeah, sure. - By the way, you missed a spot. -

 Oh, thanks. Anytime. - I'd say the car is clean enough. -

 Katherine. You two seemed awfully friendly. Do you know her? No. We

 said two words. She criticised my car washing. It's funny, when I

 criticise you, you don't put on a big goofy grin. You really

 need to stop this. Given our history, shouldn't I be saying that

 to you? Katherine, I can't just not speak to women. I'm a

 gynaecologist, for God's sake. Yes, I know. But you don't have to

 bring your work home with you. You leaving already? (SIGHS) Edie asked

 me to help her pick out a gift for her sister, so

 I gotta swing by the mall. When can I see you next?

 Well, Victor has a teachers' union thing on Thursday. Guess I'll see

 you on Thursday. Carlos, what's happening here? I mean, with us. Why

 are we still sneaking around? You know exactly why. Oh, come on.

 Edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. Don't you think it's time

 to move on? Look, I've got some things going on, and I

 need them to pay off before I can make a move. Really,

 I don't have a choice. Okay, but if you did have a

 choice, would it be a hard one? I mean, it's not like

 you're in love with Edie, is it? No, I don't love Edie.

 And I've got a plan to get her out of my life

 forever. Just give me two weeks. Okay? A bracelet is always nice.

 For Edie's sister. Good idea. (DOOR CLOSING) Here's the thing. My daughter

 has cancer. She's so nauseous, she's stopped eating, and I can't just

 stand by and watch her waste away. So I asked around, and

 people thought you might be able to get me what I need.

 You follow my drift? Yeah. You want me to score you some

 weed. The best stuff you can get. Nothing's too good for my

 little girl. - Darling. - What is it? Well, I don't want

 you to worry. I just got off the phone with the convent.

 It seems Danielle took a little spill. You're eight and a half

 months pregnant! What in heaven's name were you doing rollerblading? I'm bored!

 All I do is lay around. In your condition, that's what you

 should be doing. And where on Earth did you get skates in

 a convent? I borrowed them from one of the eating disorder girls.

 They have all the good exercise equipment. Danielle, what if your reckless

 behaviour had hurt the baby? They're going to examine me. I'm sure

 the baby's fine. Yes. And it is going to stay that way

 because I've instructed Sister Theresa to keep you sequestered in your room

 until the baby is born. What am I supposed to do for

 fun? You won't even get me a DVD player. Well, I was

 hoping that you could use these last few weeks for reflection and

 personal growth. I hate you. Clearly, it would be time well spent.

 - How was the lasagne? - Why don't you ask it yourself?

 - Honey. - Sorry. At least eat a little. We need you

 in fighting form for charades tonight. Yeah, about that, I don't think

 I'm gonna make it. You have to. You are the Charades Assassin.

 They still talk about the night that you guessed The Americanization of

 Emily in 15 seconds. Twelve, and that's my point. I'm undefeated. Why

 spoil my winning streak by playing when I'm not up to it?

 Honey, people know that you're sick. They don't expect you to be

 at your absolute best. (DOORBELL RINGING) Tom, hair loss and constant nausea,

 those are inconveniences. Losing at charades to Susan Mayer, that is just

 flat-out intolerable. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Hey, Andrew. - Hey. - What's

 up? - Hey, Mr Scavo. A package for Lynette's mom got delivered

 to our house by mistake. - Oh... - I've got it, Tom.

 It's a pattern. I'm knitting Lynette an afghan. (PATIENT COUGHING) (PHONE RINGING)

 A friend of mine recommended this place. (GLASS SHATTERING) (CAR ALARM BLARING)

 It's not exactly what I expected. Must be one heck of a

 doctor though, huh? I don't know. I just come here to buy

 clean urine. (SHOOING) Those are only for grown-ups. Why? Well, because they

 have special medicine in them. Like the grown-up iced tea you always

 drink? Similar. How about some ice cream instead? And you can watch

 TV till your eyes fall out. - Yeah! - You stay. Grandma

 needs a favour, and you've got just the face for it. Wow,

 sweetie. Those really look delicious. But I just don't feel like eating

 right now. Just one, Mom? I made them special. Just for you.

 LYNETTE: This really is delicious. If there's an emergency, you can reach

 me on my cell phone. Or they can just walk across the

 street. Have fun, girls. Don't do anything I would do. (CHUCKLING) Adam

 seems really laid back. Yeah, he's pretty cool. (DOOR CLOSING) Of course,

 everyone seems cool compared to Robo-Mom. Hey, you never told me. What

 happened when you asked her about your real dad? She freaked out,

 just like I thought. She wouldn't tell me anything. Well, there are

 other ways to find things out. Does your mom keep any old

 papers, you know, letters, diaries? Not that she shows me. There's stuff

 in the storage room upstairs, but it's locked, so forget about it.

 What kind of lock is it? Oh, come on in. I was

 hoping you were Susan. She's not here? No, and she's not answering

 her cell phone. Where is she? Well, she had an appointment with

 this new obstetrician over on River Street. She should be here by

 now. Why would she see a doctor over there? That's a terrible

 neighbourhood. - It is? - Yes. Don't you remember? That's where they

 murdered those two prostitutes last year. We should help Mike with the

 food. - Knock, knock. - We're here! Oh, good! Katherine, I was

 hoping we'd get a chance to chat. Open this now. (EDIE GROANS)

 Susan's parties are always such a snooze fest. The only thing people

 will be miming is, \"Get me the hell out of here.\" Aren't

 you a little overdressed for charades? Well, I thought that I'd look

 nice, just in case we decided to... Well, I don't know, announce

 our engagement. (CHUCKLES) We're not announcing anything. It's Susan and Mike's party.

 I do not want to make it all about us. You're right,

 darling. I may drop a few hints, though. Edie, let me be

 clear on this. You are not to tell anyone about our engagement.

 Got it? Fine. I won't say a word. Oh, this is fantastic.

 You know Edward Ferber? - State Senator? - Yes. His wife just

 got picked up for shoplifting. Why is that fantastic? He was making

 noises about going against me for governor. I guess the light-fingered Mrs

 Ferber just put an end to that. Why? It's not like he

 shoplifted. It doesn't matter. It's a scandal. You know what they do

 to poll numbers. Oh, that's right. I was reading about that in

 Politics is Boring magazine. I'm just glad I don't have to worry

 about you pulling crap like that. Yeah. You're lucky. So where's Lynette?

 She's usually your charades MVP. She wasn't feeling so well. But you

 are still going down, mister. It's just a game, Tom. A game

 you'll wish you never played. (CLEARING THROAT) Oh, hi, Gabby. Katherine and

 I were just talking about the old days. So, when you were

 living with your aunt, was Dylan's father with you? No. Just me

 and Dylan. Were you widowed or divorced? Actually, I prefer not to

 discuss my first marriage, if you don't mind. Oh, well, we certainly

 didn't mean to pry. Let me just tinge that up for you.

 Hello, all. It's so nice to see you. White wine? Oh, no,

 my contact slipped... Edie, is that an engagement ring? Oh, shoot. Pretend

 you didn't see that. I promised my fianc? that I wouldn't say

 a word until the official announcement. Oh. Excuse me. Gabby! Sorry I'm

 late. Oh, my God, you made it. That is such a beautiful

 dress. We're gonna have so much fun. You. Come with me. She's

 got a ring! - What? - Edie! She's wearing a big, honking

 engagement ring the size of a peach pit. Hey, I didn't get

 her a ring. Oh, so you're not engaged? Well, see, here's the

 thing... Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. - Let me explain. -

 No, no, no! I am done with your explanations and I am

 done with, \"Just give me two more weeks, baby.\" Whatever games you're

 playing, I'm sick of it. We're through. So you're just gonna go

 and live happily ever after with Victor, huh? You think Victor's my

 only option? Well, I got news for you, Carlos. I can have

 any guy I want. Because this waits for no man. You bought

 yourself an engagement ring? It's been three days, Carlos. How long was

 I supposed to wait? You agreed not to say anything. But I

 didn't agree not to wear anything. Don't worry, it wasn't expensive. You

 can pay me back later. Count on it. And the whole time,

 I just kept thinking, this is Bree's doctor. Bree recommended him. He

 must be the best. So I didn't worry when it was between

 a needle exchange and the area's only transvestite bookstore. And I ignored

 that my shoes stuck to the floor and there was a cigarette

 machine in the waiting room. But when I saw the ant traps

 on his speculum tray, I thought that you and I should have

 a talk. Oh, Susan, I am so sorry. And of course I

 will pay for the slashed tyre and the stolen cell phone. That

 is not the point! Why would you send me to somebody who

 is obviously not your doctor? - I can't tell you. - Why

 not? It's private. You know what else is private? The parts of

 me that I'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone. (GASPS)

 I have a party to throw. I will deal with you later.

 (SOBBING) Look, Al, she is totally out of control. I need her

 taken care of. Fine, I'll see what I can do. EDIE: I

 promised my fianc? that I wouldn't say a word until the official

 announcement. Adam, I feel the tag of my dress sticking out and

 I can't reach it. - Do you mind? - Yeah, oh, sure.

 - There you go. - Oh, I think I got a chill.

 (BOTH CHUCKLING) Now let me see if I can give you one.

 Yeah, that worked. We haven't been here an hour and you're already

 humiliating me? Are we really having this conversation again? Oh, I guess

 you learned nothing from Chicago. For God's sake, I was not flirting.

 She asked me to fix her dress. Yeah, I saw your face.

 I could tell what a chore it was for you. You know

 what? I think I'm a little behind you in the alcohol department.

 Let me go catch up. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

 but you really shouldn't take this out on Adam. Gabrielle has a

 little bit of a reputation, if you know what I mean. No,

 I don't. But I'd certainly like to. Okay, everybody, let the games

 begin! Okay, I will be team captain one. Who wants to be

 captain number two? I'll do it. Great. Okay, you pick first. Oh,

 okay, I will pick Adam. I pick Lynette. Where's Lynette? She really

 wanted to be here. She's just feeling too sick to party. (LAUGHING)

 It's funny, isn't it? Are you kidding? It's genius! He's a sponge,

 but he talks! (LAUGHING) Well, it looks like somebody is feeling a

 little better. Yeah, I guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in. That

 must be it. Orson! Carlos. Husband in the room. Honey, I love

 you, but I want to win. You should pick Edie. Why? The

 woman just tried to commit suicide. Don't make her last pick. She's

 still fragile. Good point. Mike! Yes! Let's get started. No, no! Wait,

 wait, wait. Gabby, you know how it works. Okay, first I have

 to go over all the signals. Okay! So, this is movie, TV...

 Where did you learn to do this? When you live with a

 mother who constantly locks herself out, you develop certain skills. I don't

 know. Maybe this is a sign we should stop. What were you

 saying about signs? Whole concept, person... Let's see, Shakespeare, book, and then,

 if you do the signal for book and you touch your heart,

 then that's poem. Okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as

 a clue? - Yeah, come on, let's play. - Yeah! Let's play!

 Yeah. Let's play! Hey, honey, you made it! Dibs on Lynette! She's

 on my team. No! That's not fair! She's like the charades ninja.

 That's me. The ninja. (GIGGLING) Oh, sorry! Okay! I'm ready! SUSAN: Okay,

 go! - WOMAN: Shoes! - Sock! - Working out! Black! - MAN:

 Soles! - Itch! - Corn! (MOANS) A blister? Blister! Sounds like blister!

 MAN: Kissed her. WOMAN: Sister. Two Mules For Sister Sara! (ALL SHOUTING)

 Okay, 22 seconds. Lynette, you're up. Come on, babe, we're 40 seconds

 down. We need you to make that time up. Who do you

 think you're talking to? - Right on. - KATHERINE: All right! Ready?

 Get set... Go! (EXHALES) (WHIMPERS) Honey, clock's ticking. I know. It's just,

 this is a really hard one. Okay, come on, come on! What

 is it? Is it a book? Is it a movie? Movie. It's

 a Western. - No talking! - Sorry. Honey, start with the first

 word. How many syllables? (EXHALES) One word? Sweetie, act it out. You're

 really good at that. Okay, okay, whole idea. - Me? - Edie!

 Woman! Blonde! Bleach! (GRUNTS) (IMITATES GAGGING) - Hang 'Em High? - Yes!

 Yes! Yes! Okay! Well, I think it's time for a break. Good.

 Yes. You feeling okay? Because you're acting kind of spacey. Yeah, no,

 I'm good. Hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?

 Why don't I go get you some coffee, hon? Orson, there's a

 phone call for you at the house. You should probably take it.

 - Why, hello. - Hello. - Oh, Tom. - Stella? What are

 you doing here? I made some brownies earlier, and I just noticed

 they were missing. Lynette didn't bring them here, did she? Why, is

 that a problem? - It's like chocolate love. - Oh, God. Wait,

 wait, wait, wait, wait! Sorry. Don't eat those. Don't eat those. Sorry.

 No! Oh, bad batch. Bad, bad, bad, bad. Oh, sorry, full of

 trans-fats. - Tom, watch it! - I am sorry! Oh, God, here.

 - Let me get that. - Thank you. - It's a little

 cold. - So sorry. It's all right. Would it be too much

 to ask you to keep your hands off my husband? What? I

 spilled my drink on him. And you're trying to make up for

 it by breast-feeding him? (EXHALES) Katherine! Look, lady, you need to calm

 down. You're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up

 your ass. Better that reputation than the one you're toting around. What

 do you mean by that? Okay! Back to charades! - Never mind.

 Forget it. - No, no, tell me. What's my reputation? Am I

 smug and holier-than-thou? Oh, no, wait, that's you. Let me be specific.

 By \"reputation,\" I mean that you are the kind of woman that

 treats a man like a plaything. Whether it's my husband or, let's

 say, your teenage gardener. Bree saw you slap your daughter! - Excuse

 me? - Gabby! Yeah. She asked about her father, and then you

 smacked her. Why'd you do that? This is the last thing that

 I will ever say to you. Yes, I lost my temper with

 Dylan, but her father is a horrible man. I want you to

 imagine the worst thing that a father can do to his daughter.

 What was I supposed to tell Dylan about that? I hope that

 satisfies everyone's curiosity. Oh, my God. Hang 'Em High has three syllables!

 I guess you saw what happened down there. Yep. Look, it was

 a long time ago and it didn't mean anything. How many people

 know about this? Now or before tonight? - How many? - Look,

 I know you're upset... I'm not upset. I'm just trying to work

 out how to spin this. Clearly the boy was underage. You think

 money would shut him up? Victor, really, I don't think it's a

 big deal. (SCOFFS) That's because you're not me. Okay, you've got to

 remember this. This is Bodsworth, you took him everywhere. No, I think

 I'd remember a bear that ugly. Well, clearly it's yours. Your mom

 kept it all these years, and he's here in your old room.

 Wait, this was my old room? My mom told me I'm in

 my old room, down the hall. No, this was your room. What

 are you talking about? KATHERINE: Evening, girls. Hey! How was the party?

 It was lovely. I think your mother would like you home to

 help clean up. I'm sorry, Mom. That's okay, sweetie. But I don't

 want you seeing that girl any more. Orson, honey, where have you

 been? We got a call from Danielle's doctor. Apparently her fall caused

 a placental abruption where the placenta separates from the uterus. - Oh,

 my God. - No, they said not to panic. There are degrees

 of this. They're doing a sonogram, then they're gonna call us. I

 can't wait that long. I have to be with her. Okay, I'll

 get your purse. What do you think you're doing? You can't leave

 yet! Something's come up. We'll talk tomorrow. No, we'll talk now! You

 still owe me an explanation for that skuzzy gyno you sent me

 to. I said I was sorry. For God's sake, Susan, not everything

 is about you! I know this night has been a complete disaster,

 but all in all, it's still your best party ever. I'm confused.

 (GROANS) Now I'm confused and my head hurts. That's for letting Edie

 think you're engaged. And the kiss? When you saw me flirting, you

 smashed a glass. When Victor heard I had an affair, he started

 crunching poll numbers. I need a man who cares enough to explode

 when he thinks he's gonna lose me. I don't just love you,

 I love the way you love me. So we're back on? See

 you Thursday. Al, what have you got for me? AL: I think

 I found a way to make this happen. But it might take

 a week or two to line everything up. Fantastic. I'll call you

 when it's done. Shirley, can you make some copies of the Britt

 file? Seen Gabby? Yeah. In the bathroom upstairs. Tell me something. When

 you found out that kid who you were paying to mow your

 lawn was doing your wife, how did you not kill him? Well,

 I wanted to at first. But hey, we're all human, right? You

 gotta forgive and forget. You're a very understanding man. If she pulled

 something like that on me, that guy wouldn't be around for long.

 Yeah, but no woman's worth going to jail for, right? If you

 have enough money, it's not that hard to make someone disappear. (FOOTSTEPS

 APPROACHING) Let's go, honey. Night, Carlos. Darling, what are you doing? I

 have to bring this DVD player to Danielle. Honey, we really have

 to go. It'll just take a few seconds. All these damn cords!

 Sweetheart, it's a long drive. It's the only thing she asked for.

 (PHONE RINGING) Yes, hello? Hello, doctor. How is she? - Thank God.

 - Oh. (SOBBING) It's going to be okay. (CRYING) Kids are all

 tucked in. They're sleeping like angels. Great. Did you put Quaaludes in

 their cocoa? Could you check on them for me, please? So how

 was the party? You drugged me! Just a little. What is wrong

 with you? I told you I didn't want any pot. Before you

 slap me around, let me ask you something. Do you feel better?

 That's not the point. And what were you thinking, using my son

 as a drug mule? He didn't know what was going on. And

 why are you making such a big deal about it? Let me

 ask you something. Do you remember what I wore to the junior

 prom? Or what part I had in the play that year? Who

 remembers that stuff? Parents who weren't stoned. My whole childhood passed in

 a blur because you were medicating yourself. Pot when you were sick,

 booze when you weren't. I am not going to do that. I

 won't miss a second of my kids' lives. Not if I can

 avoid it. Well, I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not. You're a

 mom. You know there's nothing worse than watching your kids suffer. And

 seeing you act all goofy watching that cartoon, well... It was probably

 the high point of my trip. I get it. But if you

 ever pull something like this again... I won't. Okay. Well, I think

 I'll turn in. - Yente. - What? Junior year. You were Yente

 in Fiddler on the Roof. You remembered. Yep. There are some performances

 so bad, even alcohol can't block them out. Bree? Can we call

 a truce, please? So you know I'm not bluffing, I brought cake.

 I am so sorry that I snapped at you tonight. It's okay.

 I just want to know what's going on. Ever since you've been

 pregnant, there's been this wall between us. It's like something's changed and

 I don't know why. Did I do something to offend you? It's

 not about you. I've just been going through some things. Like what?

 I mean, come on, just tell me. We share everything. Okay, I

 haven't told anybody this, but... It's about the baby. There have been

 some complications. Oh, no. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine, but there

 was just a time where I thought I might lose it. Oh,

 my God. And there I was just bugging you about your doctor.

 I am so sorry. You should have just told me. No, you're

 pregnant, too. I'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you.

 Oh, are you kidding? It's the first baby I've had in 17

 years. You know, I could not possibly be more freaked out. This

 morning, I caught Mike building a crib. No! This early? Yeah! I

 wanted to scream, you know, \"Are you nuts? Do you just want

 to jinx it?\" This is what we get for having kids at

 our age. Anxiety, terror... It's just going to get worse. Do you

 know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like... Dead? If

 we're lucky. Look at us! Pregnant gals, eating cake and bitching. It's

 kind of nice, huh? It really is. What are you doing? The

 hospital called. My aunt's ready to come home. And you want her

 to stay in here? Yeah. I think making this room off limits

 was a mistake. If I want Dylan to focus on other things,

 I really need to make it less intriguing. Speaking of intriguing... What

 were you thinking last night? What? Come on, \"The worst thing a

 father could do.\" You realise what people are going to think. Yeah.

 They're going to be very uncomfortable. And uncomfortable people don't ask questions.

 (KIDS SHOUTING) MARY ALICE: All children love games. But children grow up,

 and then they find new games to play. They pretend to be

 well so their families won't worry. They lie to their lovers about

 where they go in the afternoon. They invent stories to hide the

 truth from their friends. Yes, everyone has fun playing games, right up
