 ":"MARY

 ALICE: Previously on Desperate Housewives. I don't feel well. Susars health took

 a turn for the worse. Someone call 911! You have given me

 so much, Keith. One relationship came to a bittersweet end... I know

 who you are. - Get out! - Forgive me. Please. Please. I

 love you. No, you don't. ... and another ended in betrayal. The

 suburbs are full of parents, and each parent has their own style.

 There's the disciplinarian, the smotherer, and the negotiator. But the one thing

 they all have in common is they love to judge the parents

 next door. Take your sister inside, sweetie. I need to have a

 little chat with Lee. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hi! I see Jenny's practicing

 again. Two hours a day, five days a week. Wow, she is

 really into that violin. Sometimes. Mostly I have to force her to

 do it. Ooh. Big mistake. Really? Seems like you have an unsolicited

 opinion. Look, I know you're new to this parenting thing, so I'm

 gonna tell you how it works. You can't force a kid to

 do stuff, 'cause then it just leads to a lot of door-slamming

 and name-calling. And then the kid gets angry, too. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Well,

 here's the way I think it works. Jenny told us she wants

 to play the violin. So it's my job to make sure she

 sticks with it. By pushing her. I'm not pushing her. (SPEAKING MANDARIN)

 (REPLIES IN MANDARIN) What? She wanted to learn Mandarin. Look, I don't

 mean to devalue the two and a half weeks you've had as

 a father. I'm simply telling you what works. So, let me ask

 you, what's Juanita pursuing on her own? Huh? As you know, the

 school talent show is coming up. Jenny's playing the violin. What's Juanita

 going to do? Well, that's hard to say. See, the beauty of

 my method is that Juanita has explored so many things, it's hard

 to know which one to showcase. Well, this should be interesting. Two

 different parenting philosophies, and a talent show to prove which one of

 us is right. In front of hundreds of people. Yes. Will it

 be the overbearing, hypercritical father, or the loving mom who still looks

 hot in these sweats? Game on. (MAN CHATTERING ON TV) Hey, sweetie,

 I heard the talent show's coming up. What are you going to

 do? It's going to be great. Watch. (MIMICS FARTING) MARY ALICE: Yes,

 each parent has their own style. But deep down, they're all afraid

 they're doing it wrong. There are many things that bring us pleasure.

 Baking for our friends, having a good laugh, donating to charity. But

 the things that bring us pleasure may not be enough to give

 our lives meaning without someone to love. (DOOR OPENING) Morning, dear. Just

 back from the store. What the hell? I thought for dinner I

 could make those lamb chops you love so much. I got a

 great tip from the butcher. I'm searing the meat first. I kicked

 you out of this house. Oh, dear. You're still angry with me.

 But, you know, Paul, every couple has their fights. And I'll admit,

 ours was a doozy. That wasrt a fight. That was the end!

 You don't mean that. You're just upset. But don't worry, we will

 get past this. Are you out of your mind? You actually think

 I would take you back? Wait. I get it. This is another

 ploy cooked up by your sick mother. My mother. Yes. She's the

 one you're mad at. It's all her fault. She told me you

 were a monster who killed Aunt Martha. But then I fell in

 love with you, and I realized, you never could have done such

 a thing. It was all a lie. Oh, Beth. That was no

 lie. You don't mean... My God. Now we both feel betrayed. Painful,

 isn't it? Do you know what this is? A closet? No, it's

 a graveyard. A graveyard filled with all the stuff we bought because

 you told us you wanted to do something, and then quit. Remember

 this? Remember how you begged us to buy you a guitar? The

 strings hurt my fingers. GABRIELLE: Oh! What about this? Very expensive. You've

 never touched it. That's not true. I use it to pretend I'm

 playing guitar. Juanita, you are full of ideas, but you never see

 any of them through. Well, guess what? You are doing one of

 these things at that talent show. But I'm already doing something. Not

 that. Fine. If you won't pick something, I will. Ah. Tap. -

 No. - Yes. You enjoyed it! You actually set your personal record

 for sticking with something, two months. But it's hard. Let me tell

 you something about life. Anything that's won'th doing is hard. That's what

 life is? You're going back to that tap class, and you're gonna

 practice two hours a day, seven days a week until you nail

 it. No. I'll do something else at the show. Like what? I'll

 tell jokes. A Jewish guy and a Mexican walk into a bar...

 No. Thank you, Bree. It always brightens my day when you invite

 me to visit. Well, Reverend Sykes, I very much enjoy your company.

 As I do yours. Mmm. So, have you killed someone? Excuse me?

 I've always found the treats you prepare for my visits are a

 reliable indicator of your level of spiritual turmoil. The more exquisite the

 baked goods, the more anguished your soul. This is a hazelnut chocolate

 chip scone with currants. So I ask again, have you killed someone?

 No. It's just... Lately I feel like Job. You know, Job from

 the Old Testament? I'm familiar with the Book, thank you. Why do

 you think you're Job? I just feel that God has taken everything

 away from me. I lost my business. My children never call me.

 And my boyfriend Keith has left me. Well, it's not exactly body

 boils and dead camels, but I understand what you're saying. When I

 complained after I was not accepted into Yale Divinity School, my father

 had no sympathy. Instead, he drove me from our lovely home in

 Connecticut to a dangerous section of the Bronx, and forced me to

 hand out blankets to the homeless. I see. That's the reason you've

 always been so sensitive to the plight of the poor. Perhaps. It's

 certainly the reason my father was buried in a sport jacket he

 detested. The point is, looking at what has been taken from us

 is a bad way to go through life. Looking for what we

 can give to others is far better. Could you pass me the

 tape? I'm so glad I asked you to help. I'm sorry, I'm

 feeling a little faint. What is that smell? It's like sneakers mixed

 with cologne mixed with \"I ran around the block four times wearing

 a shirt made of cheese.\" That's Porter and Preston. Well, get the

 place cleaned. Yeah, I think I'm gonna hold off on that for

 a while. - Why? - Because (INHALING DEEPLY) I kind of love

 this smell. Okay, now you're becoming delirious. We gotta get you out

 of here. Hey, you don't have children, so you don't get it.

 But raising kids is an amazing experience. It is the most meaningful

 thing I've ever done. So anything that reminds me of them is

 a good thing. Hmm. You must be pretty sad they're gone. No.

 No, it's right. They're moving on with their lives. It's wonderful. Well,

 then why are there tears in your eyes? Um... That's the smell.

 (SNIFFLES) You're right. Let's get out of here. So, any idea what's

 going on with me? As much as I enjoy passing out at

 restaurants, I'm starting to get a little concerned. (CHUCKLES) According to these

 tests, your creatine levels are increasing. That's not good. Oh. Why is

 that happening? I realize this isn't a satisfying answer, but we don't

 know. So, how serious is it? I'll tell you what I tell

 all my patients. We are going to do everything we can to

 get you a kidney, but in the meantime, live your life. If

 there's things you're thinking about doing, do them now. (SIGHS) I think

 for our anniversary we should have a picnic, in the woods. Where

 we got married. Sure. That's a great idea. I think we should

 do it now. But our anniversary's not till July. Were we not

 at the same appointment just now? I thought the dialysis was supposed

 to keep you healthy. I guess it's just not working for me.

 How bad is this? SUSAN: Pretty bad. Yesterday, the doctor's secretary handed

 me this free parking pass with this sad look. It was like,

 \"Yeah, you're doomed, but your parking's free.\" So was this pass good

 for a month? A week? LYNETTE: Gabby! I just wanna know what

 we're facing here. SUSAN: All I know is, I need a new

 kidney, and there's nothing I can do till they find me one.

 Well, have you thought about trying to find a donor yourself? So

 far, you've only asked family. Yeah, widen the circle. Ask friends and

 neighbors. Well, there's not much point. I mean, finding a match is

 like, you know, one in a thousand. So ask 1,000 people! Yes!

 We can help. We can canvass the neighborhood, put up signs, go

 door to door. Guys, it's a vital organ. Susan, people care about

 you. You might be surprised what they're willing to do. I appreciate

 the thought. But I just can't ask anyone to make that kind

 of sacrifice for me. I can't. I'm gonna get you more coffee.

 Maybe she can't, but I can. Donate a kidney? Have we met?

 I'm, like, 112. But, Karen, it's for our dear friend Susan. I'm

 not having elective surgery. I take enough risk just climbing out of

 the tub. I don't know. Arert there serious risks? Actually, the mortality

 rate is quite low. I meant the scarring. I've spent a lot

 of time at the gym working off my love handles, and I

 will not give up a chance to go shirtless. No. - But

 I... - No. - She's really... - No. - Would you just...

 - No. Bree? Yes? No. I want a baby. Here. I also

 have a 9-year-old. One of my own. Preferably a boy. And in

 brown. Wait, you're serious? Where did you get this incredibly rash and

 not thought-out idea? RENEE: From you. You know, what you said yesterday,

 about kids giving your life meaning. I want that. I want meaning.

 In the form of a baby? Exactly. I already made an appointment

 with an adoption agency, which was right next door to my manicurist.

 It was like it was meant to be. Are you sure about

 this? I mean, your social calendar is very full. A baby would

 change all that. It requires a lot of sacrifice and compromise. (SCOFFS)

 Maybe the way you do it. Excuse me? You work your life

 around your kids. I intend to work my child into my life.

 No offense, but I think you make it a lot harder than

 it has to be. You know what? You might be right. But

 before you commit to being a mom, why don't you give it

 a test drive? What do you mean? You could watch Paige some

 night. Tom and I haven't been out in a while. Really? You'd

 let me babysit? (LAUGHS) Yeah! Which one is Paige? This one. Oh.

 I accept. Wow. My first step toward being a mom. You watch.

 I am gonna be a natural. (LYNETTE LAUGHS) Oh. Uh, does she

 eat shellfish? Maybe. So, I got us caviar, shrimp pate, smoked salmon.

 If there's a part of a fish they can overcharge for, we

 have it. Can you put these in the back? - Yeah. -

 Thanks. - Sweetie? - Yeah? I just want to thank you for

 doing this today. You're welcome. And you can thank me again when

 we go back in July for our real anniversary. And I'd really

 love if for the next eight hours, I'm not sick, no talk

 of kidneys. Let's just have a fun, normal day, okay? You got

 it. One fun, normal day in the woods coming up. MIKE: Nothing's

 gonna ruin this trip. (DOOR SLAMS) Hey, how was tap class? It's

 too hard. I don't wanna do it anymore. Oh, sweetie. You're doing

 it. We're not a family of quitters. Oh! You quit all the

 time. Yesterday we played hide and seek, Celia and I looked for

 you for an hour before we saw your car was gone. So

 I found a great hiding place at the shoe store. That's not

 quitting. All right, look, let me ask you something. Are you getting

 better? I guess. Well, there you go. Now go upstairs and change.

 Oh! And remember, tomorrow's lessors two hours. You're gonna make my feet

 fall off. I can't wait for this to be over. Why are

 you working her so hard? It's a lousy school talent show. You

 think Bob and Lee are going easy on their kid? No, they

 push her! That girl's so good at the violin, she's practically Asian.

 So that's what this is about. You're competing with Bob and Lee.

 (SCOFFS) That's ridiculous. This is about Juanita. Building her self-esteem and giving

 her a chance to shine. And if a couple of same-sex parents

 end up crying at home in their silk kimonos, so be it.

 Oh, Mike, look at this place. Isn't it as beautiful as you

 remember it? Yeah. Lucky I didn't leave it on the roof of

 the car. (SIGHS) Will you forget about the picnic basket? Guess you're

 right. What's important is we're together and there's... Damn it! They forgot

 the fries! Unbelievable. Okay, Mike. Look at me. Think back eight years,

 when we stood in this spot and we pledged our love to

 each other. - Mmm-hmm. - Oh! I know. Let's renew our vows.

 (SUSAN GIGGLES) That's a great idea. I, Mike Delfino, promise to love...

 (BIRD SQUAWKS) I, Mike Delfino, promise to... (BIRD SQUAWKS) It's just a

 bird. Forget it. Promise to love and honor... (BIRD SQUAWKING) Okay, now

 he's just mocking me! But... Mike. Mike, stop! Oh, my God. I

 can't believe you hit that bird. Yeah, I know. (BIRD SQUAWKING) I

 was aiming for that one. As the gayest person at this brunch,

 I feel it is my duty to say, \"Fabulous!\" Yeah, Bree, what's

 the occasion? Nothing. Just a little get-together for friends. - Smoked salmon

 tartare cornucopia? - Mmm. This feels weird. She's up to something. Oh,

 what are you talking about? It's just a brunch. Excuse me, if

 I could borrow a moment of your time for a brief presentation.

 - Oh, God, you're right. It's an ambush. - Mmm-hmm. - (GABRIELLE

 HISSES) - It seems many of you have some misguided ideas about

 kidney donation, so I have invited Craig Lynwood, transplant coordinator at Fairview

 Memorial, to dispel some of those myths. Mr. Lynwood, is it true

 there's an age limit to donating? No. Not necessarily. And does the

 surgery cause unsightly scarring? It's laparoscopic. The scarring is minimal. Well, I

 don't know about the rest of you, but I find that very

 reassuring. So now that we have the facts, I am sure you'll

 all wanna get tested. Okay, fine. I'll go in next week. BREE:

 No need. Nurse Dearborn? So, the line forms over here. And we

 won't take no for an answer. You're gonna get tested? No. I

 think I can take Gabby. I don't know how Paul found out,

 Mama, but he did. And then... Well, he threw me out. He

 was just so cold. What a sad story. If only someone had

 warned you what a bastard he is. I know. You were right

 all along. I should've listened to you. But I'm going to make

 it up to you. Oh, Beth. I can't allow you back in

 my life. You have failed me in every possible way. No, I

 didn't. Paul confessed. Really? Did you get it on tape? Did he

 write it on a napkin? Of course not. Because you've never done

 anything right in your life. Give me another chance. I'll do anything.

 (SIGHS) I have no more use for you. Goodbye. Wait! I have

 nowhere to go. What's going to happen to me, Mama? You're gonna

 live a lonely, depressing life in some ratty apartment, with plenty of

 time to think about all the people you disappointed. Most of all,

 me. Guard! I'm done here. Take her off the visitors list. ANNOUNCER:

 The Oakridge School Talent Show starts in five minutes. So, checking out

 Fairview's answer to ltzhak Perlman? I don't know what that is, but

 if it's German for \"cat strangler,\" then, yes. It's like that, is

 it? So, whers your daughter start stomping off to Buffalo? She's on

 right before Jenny. So, you might want to keep your sunglasses handy

 because Juanita is going to be dazzling. Honey, are you okay? Were

 you being chased by a bee? No, it's my routine. That's the

 first time I've nailed the finale. That was you nailing it? To

 the floor. Bam! Performers, to the stage! Uh... Where are my tap

 shoes? I don't know. I left them right here. Honey, I guess

 you lost them, and the show's about to start. Dang it! I

 can't believe this. I was so excited. I worked so hard. I'm

 sorry. Do you want to stay and watch your friends? We can

 go after for ice cream. Who cares? I will see your shirt,

 and I will raise you one bra. Nicely played. (RUSTLING) Do you

 hear something? Probably just a peeping raccoon. No. No, I think there's

 someone out there. (GUN FIRES) (SOLDIERS CHATTERING) What the hell? (GRUNTS) Identify

 yourselves. Are you Northern agitators? Do we look like Northern agitators? We're

 just celebrating our anniversary. You guys playing paintball or something? No, madam,

 we are not playing! I am Major General Jedediah Garrett of the

 Confederate Army, and we... Kevin, Kevin. Kevin! Hi. Hi. We're part of

 a Civil War reenactment group. Yeah, I know, I know. Get a

 real life, right? Look, can't you just have your pretend war over

 there? Pretend? You, sir, are interrupting the Battle of Fredericksburg! Actually, we

 have the entire park until 6:00. Kyle, show them the permit. It's

 fine. We believe you. No, it's not fine. This is really important

 to her. So, just give us a couple of hours. No, sir.

 Now, be gone! Men, we must be ready to attack the enemy

 should they attempt to retreat into Maryland. What a douche. A douche,

 you say? Yeah. SUSAN: Mike! Let's just go. (GASPS) Eyes closed, Kyle.

 You're supposed to be dead. I died with my eyes open. It

 happens. Close them, Kyle! (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) And now, to close our

 show is a violin solo by Jenny Hunter-McDermott. (PLAYING SOLEMN TUNE) (OFF-KE

 Y) (CHUCKLES) She lives next door to me. We're getting those double-paned

 windows. Okay. Ouch! Poor Lee. He must be pretty embarrassed. Does he

 look embarrassed? She always stumbles over that part. She really stumbled over

 it today. But she powered through. We couldn't be prouder. Wait! Wait,

 wait, wait! Nobody move! Okay, don't leave yet. There's still one girl

 who hasn't performed yet. But I lost my tap shoes. Oh, that's

 right. Hey! Wait, is that them in the back room behind the

 radiator? (SQUEALS) Bravo! (SUSAN SIGHS) Look, we had a great day. Think

 of it this way, now we have a funny story to tell

 people. (ENGINE STALLING) Two funny stories. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Bree, it's Craig

 Lynwood. I have some great news. All your efforts have paid off.

 You found a match? We found two. Oh, my God. It's a

 miracle! Who are they? Well, one of them is you. Bree? Are

 you there? I'm sorry. It's just... (STUTTERS) I wasrt expecting this. Who's

 the other one? A woman named Beth Young. Beth? I didn't even

 know she got tested. Apparently, she saw one of your flyers. And

 she wants to do this? Well, I don't know yet. We're having

 a hard time getting in touch with her. So, should we continue

 to look for this Beth Young, or is the donor going to

 be you? Fancy. I thought we were just gonna grab a burger.

 Renee was really talking this place up, so I thought we could

 splurge. Or we could stay home and eat money. We better order.

 Any second, my phone is going to ring, and Renee's gonna beg

 me to rush home and get Paige. I don't know. She might

 surprise you. (BAB Y CRYING) Oh, great. One night out and we

 have to listen to that. Who brings a baby to a place

 like this? Hey, let's give the parents that dirty look that we

 always get. - Like... - Yeah. (GASPS) Oh, my God! It's Renee!

 On a date! With our baby! Unbelievable. And you thought she'd be

 good at this? Oh, look at that. What, what is she doing

 now? Nothing, the filet mignon just went by. It looks amazing. So,

 should we just go over and get Paige? Not yet. I want

 to watch. Okay, look, look, there you go. She's probably ordering milk

 for Paige. Or she's giving our baby away! Wow! She really is

 bad at this. Oh! Excuse me. Hi. I'll be right over to

 take your order. Why did that woman give you this baby? She

 gave me $ 100 to see if I could calm her down.

 But I don't mind. I love children. I'm actually expecting my third.

 Really, that's beautiful. Listen, how would you like to make $200? Are

 you ready to order? Have you forgotten something? Your drinks will be

 right out. No. No, no. Not the drinks, the baby. I gave

 you a baby? Where is it? I had orders backing up, so

 I gave it to a busboy. What? What busboy? Um... He should

 be here somewhere. I hope he didn't finish his shift and go

 home. You better find me that baby. Or I'm gonna take that

 one, now! Busboy, are you the one that has a baby? I'm

 looking for a baby! Two feet tall, big head, drools. I'm looking

 for a baby. Did anyone pass you a baby? Has anyone seen

 a baby? Had enough? In a minute. That vein in her head

 is really going. Do you know where there's a baby? Because they

 gave it to me, I don't know where the baby is! Lynette.

 And Paige. How did you get Paige? What are you doing with

 Paige? You took our baby on a date. Well, Brian called. It

 was his one night in town. Well, then you say, \"Sorry, Brian,

 I can't make it tonight.\" That's what being a mother is about,

 making sacrifices. Something you know absolutely nothing about! Ah! Come on, Tom.

 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Beth? It's Bree Van De Kamp. Um... Coming! I

 went to your house. Paul told me you were here. We aren't

 together anymore. I'm so sorry. It is what it is. Thanks for

 checking on me. Well, actually, the reason I came by... Has the

 gentleman from the transplant office reached you? Why? Am I a match?

 - Yes! - Wow! So, what do I do now? Is there

 someone I need to call? Are there forms? Well, that won't be

 necessary because I'm a match, too. What? I know. Two in the

 same neighborhood. We're very blessed. Anyway, I am going to be Susars

 donor. But I wanted to thank you for getting tested. When you

 moved onto the Lane, I didn't give you a chance. I saw

 you as a woman who married a man I hated, and I

 see now that you're so much more than that. I'm sorry it

 took me so long to realize it. Well, I... I should go.

 I wanna do it. Beth, no! Please, Bree. Let me help Susan.

 It would really mean a lot to me. Beth, what I'm about

 to say may not make sense to you, but I've been going

 through a dark time. Feeling alone and unconnected and wondering if I

 have a purpose. So, for me to be able to do this

 for my friend, it may mean a lot to you, but it

 means everything to me. Thank you for understanding. Sorry about last night.

 I bought this for the baby. Wow! Expensive, fragile, pointy. If only

 it were flammable. I'm not really cut out to be a mother,

 am I? No. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's not for

 everyone. What's sad is how many people go ahead and have kids

 anyway. Well, what do people do to fill up the hole in

 their lives? No matter what I do, no matter who I'm with,

 I feel alone. You'll find something. And when you do, you'll be

 glad you have the room. Lots and lots of room. (CHUCKLES) Thanks.

 I'm so glad I stopped by. Hey. We're about to eat. Why

 don't you join us? Okay. Okay. But keep the baby on your

 side of the table. What? I'd probably let her play with my

 knife. (CHUCKLES) Ow! God! Son of a bitch! - Let me look

 at it. - No. Are you okay? Mike, are you okay? No,

 I'm not okay! We never should have come here! Instead of waiting

 for our real anniversary, we wasted our time on this disaster! Is

 that why you're yelling at me? Because I... Because I moved up

 our anniversary? Because you're dying. You're dying, and there's not a damn

 thing I can do about it. Look, I'm sorry. But it feels

 like you're getting ready to say goodbye. Like you're bailing on me.

 Bailing? I am fighting! I am scared, I don't know what's going

 to happen, but I am fighting my ass off. I wanna see

 MJ graduate. I wanna grow old with you. I want all of

 that. But in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy every moment of

 every day. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Let's get out of here. (MIKE GROANS)

 Hey, lean on me. I'm a lot stronger than you think. MARY

 ALICE: Our lives are brief. That's why it's important to search for

 meaning. We find it in our daughter's smile, in the warmth of

 our friends, or the comfort of our faith. Then there are those

 who make their lives meaningful by making a great sacrifice. Hello, my

 name is Beth Young. I'm here to donate a kidney. I just

 found out I'm a match for a friend of mine. I'm sorry,

 ma'am, you're in the wrong place. You want the transplant office on

 the fourth floor. These are my forms. I think you'll see they're

 all completely filled out. Again, ma'am, you want the transplant office. This

 is Emergency. My friend's name is Susan Delfino. It's funny, at first

 we didn't get along very well. Actually, we never got along. But

 that kind of thing seems so insignificant when someone is in need.

 That's great. Fourth floor. Elevator's down the hall. I really don't mean

 to trouble you, but these forms have to get to the right

 place. I don't want to mess this up. It's the most important

 thing I've ever done. Okay. I'll take care of it. Thank you

 so much. You're very kind. (GUN FIRES) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) We need some
