 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: George paid for what he did to your father.

 - Bree confessed... - Did you give Zach money to go to

 Utah? Susan betrayed Mike... - What kind of friend is he? -

 The real good kind. Andrew pushed the boundaries... - Zach's come home.

 - Is there anything I can do? - Paul put his foot

 down... - You can leave us alone. - When do I tell

 people you'll be back? - Maybe three days. ...and a stranger finally

 caught up with Caleb. Kisses are such simple things, we hardly notice

 them. But if we paid more attention, we'd see that each kiss

 conveys a meaning all its own. For example, some can say, \"I'm

 so happy to see you.\" Or, \"I didn't realise you'd be here.\"

 Or, \"Honey, it's time to stop drinking.\" The trick is in knowing

 how to tell the difference. So I finally said, \"If I'm head

 cheerleader, then nobody wears panties.\" Yeah! As a former member of my

 high school marching band, I would've appreciated that. You were a band

 geek? Oh, I don't believe it. - What did you play? -

 He played the tuba. I have pictures. The tuba, huh? Yeah. Go

 ahead. Come on. Get your licks in. Not at all. As a

 matter of fact, all of my secret crushes - were on the

 band geeks. - I know you cheerleader types. You wouldn't have said

 \"boo\" to guys like me. You were more interested in guys like

 this. I take it you didn't play the tuba. No, I didn't.

 All I know is, I was a Ionely, insecure tuba player. Girls

 like Gabrielle would just rip my heart out. I didn't even have

 my first kiss until I was 18. - Eighteen? - Pathetic, I

 know. Poor baby. I would have kissed you. - You wouldn't have.

 - I would've. No, you wouldn't have. And it's OK, Gabby. -

 Those scars healed a long time ago. - Oh, for God sakes,

 come here. Now, on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,

 forgive us. Yes, kisses mean different things to different people. Ultimately, the

 meaning depends on the one who does the kissing... Wowie. Cheers! ...and

 the one who sees it happen. After every party comes the time

 for cleaning. We attend to the champagne that was spilled, the knickknacks

 that got broken, the food that went uneaten... - Oh, here. Let

 me take that. - Oh. Thanks. ...and whatever other messes need cleaning

 up. So, Gabby, you know that thing you and Tom did tonight,

 the... The kiss? Was that hysterical? The look on Tom's face. Yeah.

 I know this sounds silly, but... it kind of bugged me. -

 You're not serious. - Well, I am. I don't... I don't want

 to make a big deal out of it, but, could you maybe...

 not do that again? OK. Thanks. OK. What happened to the Applewhites?

 You were going to invite them. I did. Betty never RSVP'd. What

 do you guys think about the Applewhites? I like them. Very nice.

 Very... - Interesting. - Interesting. They weird me out too. That's not

 what we're saying. Not exactly, anyway. You know, we were just having

 fun, entertaining the crowd. Oh, sure. But maybe next time you could

 try juggling instead. - What's going on? - Nothing. Really? I sense

 a little tension. No, no tension. What? You make it sound like

 I was making a pass at your husband and that's just a

 little bit insulting. I just said it bugged me. Why is that

 a problem? - Is this about that kiss? - What kiss? Oh,

 you were in the living room. Gabby planted a big, wet kiss

 on Tom, as a joke. It was hilarious. You see? Yeah, but

 to be fair to Lynette, you are an ex-model. Surely it must

 have dawned on you that some women might prefer it - if

 you didn't kiss their husbands. - That's all I'm saying. Oh, you

 guys, we're all friends. This isn't something to get worked up over.

 I'm not worked up. Me neither. Hey, everyone, did you see what

 Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight? Whoever told her she could get away

 with those stripes should be shot. Oh, bye, sweetie. Oh... Zach is

 back. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. - You do? Yeah, he's been

 back for a couple of days now. - Well, that's great, isn't

 it? - Yeah. I thought you'd be happy about it, that's what

 you wanted. I was hoping I'd slowly establish a relationship with Zach,

 then when we were comfortable, I'd tell him I was his dad.

 But Paul's back. He doesn't want you anywhere near him. He's threatened

 to tell the police everything that happened in the desert, - that

 I held a gun to his head. - It's your word against

 his. But he doesn't have a record. I do. You know, despite

 what I did, sending Zach away, I want you two to connect.

 - I hope you know that. - I do. And on the

 bright side, I don't have to wonder where he is anymore. It

 says that you can do a report on anything from the suggested

 reading list. Which includes The Old Man and the Sea, The Pearl,

 Much Ado About Nothing... That sounds good. What do you like? I

 don't care. Let's start with The Pearl. It's got a sad ending,

 but it's good. We'll start with that. You know, it's not gonna

 be so bad. I think you're really gonna like being home-schooled. OK,

 I know this isn't what you want. But I need to keep

 you close to me, just for a while. There are people in

 this neighbourhood who aren't thrilled that we're back. People I don't trust.

 People like Mike Delfino? Why would you say that? When you disappeared,

 Mrs Tillman said that Mike took you somewhere to kill you. That's

 ridiculous. - Why would Mike want to kill me? - Because you

 murdered Mrs Huber? What did you say? Well, Mrs Tillman said that

 you murdered Mrs Huber because she was blackmailing Mom. - And you

 believed her? - No, not exactly. Why? Should I? Zach, you know

 me. Better than anyone. Do you honestly believe that I'm capable of

 murder? No. All right, then. Of course... I didn't think Mom was

 capable of suicide, either. On second thought, why don't we start with

 Much Ado About Nothing. I think we could use a few laughs

 around here. Man, yeah, he sure is. That just... Probably... - Yeah.

 - Not bad. All right. Hey. Get over here, now! Somebody's angry.

 Did one of your souffl?s fall? I saw what you did with

 your friend. Oh. And you didn't turn into a pillar of salt.

 Good for you. This is not a joke, Andrew. What if the

 neighbours had seen you? Well, I'd hope they'd think that I landed

 a hottie. I may not be able to control what you do

 outside of this home. But while you are under this roof, you

 will not mock my values. If you so much as smile at

 that boy, so help me I will ship you off to Camp

 Hennessey and I will not pick you up again until you're 18.

 Do I make myself clear? Aren't you forgetting something? I know you

 like to knock a few back before bedtime. Go on. Take it.

 It's OK. We both know that of the two of us, I'm

 the one that doesn't judge. Please. I don't want to stay down

 here. I... I know. I'm sorry, Cay. I'm sorry. Matthew, I think

 we might have termites. You need to take a look at those

 steps before one of us breaks our neck. What's the matter? Is

 your brother OK? No, he's not. He hates it down here. He

 wants to be with us. You're being cruel. If you are so

 concerned about him, you should spend less time on your computer and

 more time down here keeping him company. We're bringing him up, but

 not until I'm sure that it's safe. Hey, you! Yeah? What's the

 deal? You've been parked on our street for two hours. Oh. I'm

 doing a property appraisal. Some neighbours of yours are thinking about moving.

 - The Applewhites? - I'm not really allowed to say. I sold

 them that house. You know, this is my turf. Who do you

 work for? Geist Realty? Westside Properties! Whoever it is, you go back

 and you tell your bosses that nobody, and I mean nobody, buys

 or sells in this neighbourhood without going through Edie Britt. You got

 that? - Look, lady, I just go where I'm told. - You

 look. You cross me, and I will be your worst nightmare. I'm

 a dangerous woman. You don't want to mess with me. You got

 it. Ms Mayer? - Zach. - May I talk to you? I

 have some things that I need to say. - OK. - I

 know that I did a lot of bad stuff. Stuff that I'm

 not gonna be able to take back. Ms Mayer, I'm... I'm really

 sorry. But when I was living on the streets, I had a

 lot of time to just sit and think to myself and clear

 my head, and... I've grown up, you know? I... I don't want

 you to worry, I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore. Either of

 you. Well, thanks. We appreciate that. Please don't tell my dad that

 I talked to you. He's just... He's been really intense lately. Wow.

 What do you think? He seems different. I believe him. Yeah. I

 can't believe I'm about to say this but I feel sorry for

 him. It's like he's so fragile. I know. And he's locked up

 in that house with Mr Creepy 24-7. Did you know that he's

 home-schooling Zach now? I think he should spend some time with a

 decent role model, don't you? Hi! Hey. You're out early. I wanted

 to pick up fresh croissants for breakfast. Oh, cool. Listen, I just

 wanted you to know, I appreciated you backing me up last night.

 You know, with the kiss thing. To be honest, I don't think

 I would have liked it, either. Yeah, but I probably should've just

 gone with it. Gabby was just being Gabby, having fun. Well, I

 wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history. - What do

 you mean? - You know, the affair. Gabby had an affair? -

 You didn't know? - No! I thought everybody knew. Oh, I feel

 awful. Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you. Ida, just a second! I am

 stunned. Who was it with? - I shouldn't have said anything. -

 Come on. Just tell me. Her gardener. Oh, you're kidding! No, no,

 not him. Helen Rowland's son, John. The teenager? Ida, wait or go

 around! - Does Gabby know that you know? - Absolutely not! I

 think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you

 don't know anything. Hi. Oh! Sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm all

 right. What's up? We have an idea how to bring you and

 Zach together. Bowling. - Bowling? - I e-mailed Zach and he said

 he's gonna meet us there. You can come too. Does Paul know

 about this? No. And we're not planning on telling him. I don't

 think that's a good idea, Susan. Mike, I'm part of the reason

 things got so screwed up. I just want a chance to make

 things right. And you're OK with this, being around Zach? We talked

 to him. He's changed. Well, I guess we're going bowling. Wake up,

 sleepyhead. I brought fresh croissants for breakfast. Hi, Mrs Van De Kamp.

 I'm Justin, Andrew's lab partner. From school. Dude, wake up. Andrew. I

 want you downstairs. Now! First of all, I want you to march

 back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in

 this house. - We haven't had breakfast yet. - I am serious.

 You tell him to get out of here or I will call

 the police - and I will have him removed. - Well, go

 ahead. Call them. Oh, you think I won't? I just wonder how

 they'll react when they find out that you killed George Williams. I

 didn't kill George. No, but you sat there and let him die.

 Which... I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure there's a crime in

 there somewhere. - Andrew... - Don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm

 glad you did it. But when the cops get here, my official

 position will be, \"Oh, my God, I'm being raised by a homicidal

 maniac!\" I think I might even throw in a few tears. You

 would actually let the police arrest your own mother? Hey. We all

 gotta cut the apron strings at some point. Come on, Penny. Let's

 get those groceries in there. Come on, here we go. We'll get

 this one, this one and Daddy... Uh-oh. Whoa. Oh, oh... Oh! It

 looks like you could use a hand. - Bless you. Here, Gabby,

 and Penny. - Oh. Come here, you sweet little thing. Well, thank

 you so much, Gabby. Come on in. Oh, God, Tom? - Yeah?

 - I think she got sick. Oh, I'm so sorry. Usually she

 only throws up on immediate family. I'm honoured. Oh, do you mind

 just putting her in the playpen there? Hello? Guess what? Ed loved

 the pitch. I got off early. You're kidding. That's great. I'm by

 the market. Want me to pick up anything? I just came from

 there. Except, I forgot bread. - Would you mind? - Not at

 all. Tom, I need to wipe up. Do you have a towel?

 Sure, hold on. - Hey. - Hey, honey. - Hey, did you

 get the bread? - Oh, they were out. - Of bread? -

 Yeah. Hey, Gabby. Surprise seeing you here. I saw that Tom was

 overwhelmed, so I thought I'd give him a hand. Really? Well, that

 was nice of you. Is there a problem? No. Really? I sense

 that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. Am

 I wrong? Lynette? OK. Yeah. So exactly what are you doing here,

 helping out? Damn it, if this has to do with that stupid

 kiss, I'm gonna lose it. What's going on? Lynette thinks I was

 hitting on you at Bree's party. - What? That's ridiculous. - I

 never said that. What I said was that it made me uncomfortable

 when you kissed him. It's obviously an issue for me, and yet

 here you are, alone in my kitchen, with my husband. So, tell

 me, are you hitting on him? - Lynette. - I can't believe

 you. I have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust. Well,

 that's not entirely true. What does that mean? Come on, Gabby, it's

 a small town. People talk. OK, what's going on here? I'll tell

 you. Your wife doesn't trust me around you because I had an

 affair with my teenage gardener. Oh. I know Susan Mayer would never

 tell, so it must have been Helen Rowland. She blabbed to the

 girls at the salon. Ida Greenberg goes to that salon. If Ida

 knows, the whole town knows and we're gonna have to move. That's

 all there is to it. Carlos! Can you stop putting for two

 seconds and show me some support? What do you expect? You brought

 this on yourself. It was a harmless little kiss. Why is everybody

 making a big deal about this? Because you had an affair with

 an underage gardener. People don't think you're harmless. They see you as

 a predator. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Punishing me, dangling the affair

 over my head. Well, I won't tolerate it. Really? So just what

 are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna let you even the

 score. - Carlos, go have an affair. - What? I had my

 indiscretion, so go have yours, get it out of your system. I

 know you want to. - I do not. - Sure you do.

 Knock yourself out. Call up an old college flame. Rent a call

 girl. Fly to Africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling

 over. - I don't care. - You're crazy. No, I'm pragmatic. Because

 once you've finished your fling, we'll be equals again and then you

 won't be able to judge me. And we can go back to

 being a boring, average married couple. Oh, just do me a favour,

 don't bring back any diseases. Are you sure you're not overreacting to

 this whole Gabrielle thing? Maybe. Yes. But Gabby doesn't think she did

 anything wrong. That's not right either. I guess. You're an attractive man.

 There is a primal need for a woman to protect what is

 hers. My initial impulse was justified. So you really think she's into

 me? I don't know. Because you're right. I am an attractive man.

 You know what, I never told you this, but when I bend

 down to pick up the morning paper, I catch Bree Van De

 Kamp checking me out. - You're kidding. - No, scout's honour. I've

 always exuded a certain sexual magnetism, and as I get older, I

 think it's only becoming more intense. Are you drunk? Oh, I'm a

 hot guy, living in a neighbourhood - filled with nothing but Ionely

 ladies. - Oh. They can't help themselves. I'm like catnip. Come here.

 - What was that for? - Thank you. Thank you for reminding

 me that I am the only woman in the whole world who

 could love an idiot like you. - I'll talk to Gabby. -

 I'm telling you, these women want me. - Oh, yeah. - They

 see the rippling muscles... - Good night, Tom. - They cannot resist

 me. Shut up and go to sleep. Son of a bitch. You

 gotta be kidding me. Whoa, whoa. I'm here to help you, Caleb.

 Momma's gonna be mad. Don't you worry about that. Moms love me.

 All right. Let's go. No! OK, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked

 to you like that. Let's start over. Let's go. I'm warning you,

 pinhead. Don't you make me come down there after you. Come on.

 Come on! You asked for it. I'm gonna beat the stupid right

 out of you. This thing was dry... Caleb? I didn't do it.

 Oh, dear. - Well, hey, there. - Hi, Karl. Oh. Oh, quick

 question. When someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer, such as

 yourself, when does attorney-client confidentiality kick in? From the moment the lawyer's

 hired. Why? Here's a cheque for a hundred dollars. That's enough for

 a retainer, right? I guess. What's going on, Bree? My son is

 trying to blackmail me, and I want you to stop the little

 SOB. Do you think you could do that? He has an Illinois

 license. Says here his name is Monroe. Does that name mean anything

 to you? No. But at least he wasn't a policeman. Poor man.

 I hope he didn't suffer too much. Mom, are we looking at

 the same body? What is it? As soon as it gets dark,

 we get rid of that body. Hey. I hope it's OK. Carlos

 let me in. I'm right in the middle of something and I

 don't know when I'll be done. I'm just here to say I

 am sorry and I have been a complete idiot. All done. -

 Is the coast clear? - Yes, it is. We worked it out.

 No kidding. How'd you manage that one? Simple. Lynette admitted she was

 wrong and I agreed. Well, 99 percent wrong. Oh, whatever. Close enough.

 Anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now. - So I should

 get going. - OK. Bye. Good night. You know what the one

 percent is, right? No, not really. - Does it matter? - It

 kind of does. I... I want to get it clear, for our

 friendship. OK. What's the one percent? Well... Well, yes, I overreacted. I

 think you can see how even though I was somewhat off base,

 you were a little wrong, right? No. I kissed Tom and it

 was a harmless joke. If I had kissed anybody else's husband they

 would have laughed and then forgot about it 10 seconds later. OK.

 Let's test that theory. See. I don't care. That's just a waste

 of time. And spit. OK. OK. OK, OK. OK, OK. - I

 get your point! - All righty then. My work here is done.

 Carlos. Gabby. - Oh! - Not bad. Hey. There he is. Zach!

 I'm glad you could make it. Hey, Zach. Mr Delfino. I didn't

 know you were gonna be here. I was bowling a few frames

 and ran into these guys. Thought I might join you. Is that

 OK? Yeah. I guess. - OK, write that down, nine. - Wise

 guy. All right, just roll it in there, nice and easy. -

 Sorry. - Hey, it's OK. We're still close. Anyway, Julie's totally gonna

 choke. Oh! Just for that, I am not bringing you back a

 hot dog. - Zach, do you want one? - OK. - You

 OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just... I don't understand what you're

 doing. What do you mean? Well, I don't understand why you're being

 so nice to me. I pointed a gun at you guys. You

 should hate me. We don't hate you, Zach. You had an incredibly

 hard year. You shouldn't have done what you did, but we just

 want to help you move on. Look, when I was young, I

 got mixed up in some really bad stuff. I even did some

 time in prison. - Really? - Yeah, but when I got out,

 people were willing to forgive me. - Everybody deserves a second chance.

 - Thanks. You know, I'm gonna go, help Julie with the food.

 So you guys just keep talking and bowling. Talk and bowl, bowl

 and talk. Here, let me show you something. See the arrows right

 in the middle? Just roll it straight over the one in the

 centre. You don't have to spin it or anything, just right down

 the middle. Look at that! Good job. - Hurry up! - I

 am hurrying up, OK? - Wait, no, no, no! - What? I

 dropped the keys. I don't have them. They're in here! Sometimes you

 just have to laugh. Andrew, would you mind turning off your video

 game? My lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.

 Even though your mother did witness George Williams' suicide, there's no affirmative

 duty to intervene. No crime was committed. Even if the police find

 out, your mom will never see the inside of a courtroom. Well,

 maybe I got the story wrong. What if she went over there

 to help him commit suicide? If you want to lie to the

 police, go right ahead. But please know that I will sue you.

 - For what? - Abuse of process. When a person tries to

 exploit the legal system for an improper purpose, like blackmail. You guys

 can't sue me. I'm just a kid. Don't worry. I won't start

 garnishing your wages until you turn 18. Your mom, is she a

 peach or what? If the cops don't give a damn, I'm sure

 your friends will. How does a little public humiliation sound? Bree, can

 I get a refill on this? - What are you doing? -

 Your father was a friend of mine. And if he were around

 to see what a nasty little turd you've turned into, he'd knock

 the hell out of you. Yeah, well, he's not here now, is

 he? No, he isn't. But if you don't get your act together

 and start treating your mother with some respect, I'll take care of

 you myself. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. Good. - Hey,

 neighbour. - Oh, hey, Carlos. Hi. I just wanted to thank you

 for patching things up with Gabby. Well, sure, no problem. It's been

 really tough on her, everybody finding out about the affair. Yeah, I

 can imagine. I don't mind telling you, it's, it's been pretty tough

 on us the past couple months. Oh, well, I'm not surprised, and

 I really hope you can work it out. Yeah. We're trying. -

 You know... - Yeah? - Gabby had an interesting suggestion. - Oh?

 She told me that I should go out and have an affair

 of my own. She thinks it's the only way I'll be able

 to get over what she did, and that it just might help

 our marriage. Why are you telling me this? I guess I just,

 wanted to know if you had any thoughts on the subject. I

 don't. I really don't. Well, if you ever do, let me know.

 By the way... That was one hell of a kiss you gave

 me. You can't fake chemistry like that. What the hell is this?

 Delfino. Stay away from my son! Oh, my God! Dad! - You

 OK? - I'm fine. I swerved to avoid hitting his car and

 I hit this parked car. That's when the trunk popped open. And

 when we got out, we found this dead body, and... Are you

 worried now? Because I am. Not yet. Let's be patient, see what

 happens. How'd it go? Well, I told them everything I know, which

 wasn't much. So are we thinking this is Paul? Well, he is

 our friendly neighbourhood murderer. - Yeah, it seems obvious. - I don't

 know. I saw his face when he looked in the trunk. He

 looked just as shocked as I was. I'm thinking it's the Applewhites.

 I talked to the dead guy and he said that he was

 doing an appraisal on their house. Well, I got a little cheesed,

 so I called every realtor in town. Nobody had even heard of

 him. - That doesn't mean Betty knew him. - Please. Those two

 are fishy. They bought that house sight unseen. And they did move

 in in the middle of the night. And there were the noises.

 What noises? Oh, a couple of weeks ago, I heard some noises

 coming from the basement, like a clanging. And I asked Betty about

 it. She lied right to my face. - What's that about? -

 I don't know. Now I'm worried. - I'll call you. - So

 long, girlfriend. Julie. Hi. Hey. My dad found out about us bowling.

 We're not gonna be able to do that anytime soon. Oh. Sorry.

 No, no, I'm glad that we did. I haven't felt like part

 of a family in a long time. Thanks. I, I'd better get

 back inside. The act itself never varies, but each kiss carries with

 it - a meaning all its own. - Oh! It can convey

 a husband's eternal devotion. Or a wife's enormous regret. It can symbolise

 a mother's growing concern. Or a lover's growing passion. But whatever its

 meaning, each kiss... ...reflects a basic human need. Mommy's baby. The need

 to connect to another human being. This desire is so strong... ...it's
