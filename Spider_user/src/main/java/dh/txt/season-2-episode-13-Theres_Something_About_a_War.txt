 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: If you come between me and my husband, I

 will take you down. Bring it on. - Gabrielle threatened a nun.

 - You're good to go. Susan hit on her doctor. So you

 came to ask me out? Cos I'll say yes. And Bree's daughter

 let her intentions be known. It's amazing how far we're willing to

 go... Andrew, give me one reason why I shouldn't call the police.

 - Because I'm your son. ...all in the name of love. If

 there was one thing Edie Britt understood, it was the nature of

 war. After two failed marriages and countless rocky romances, she had learned

 that love was a battlefield. And the easiest way to survive the

 carnage... ...was total surrender. I was thinking a vacation to Rome would

 be so romantic. Vegas is cheaper. Oh. Could you put your underwear

 in the hamper? Can you do it? You're standing right there. I've

 got a hankering for Chinese food tonight. Oh, I'm so over rice.

 Let's do pizza. But the day comes for every soldier when she

 must take a stand... - What do you think you're doing? ...and

 fight. It's time for my game. I want to watch my movie.

 Edie... ...this is important to me. Fine. I have stuff to do

 anyway. You see, when it came to men, Edie had a battle

 plan all her own. Got five minutes for Edie? Wow. That's some

 knot you tied. Yeah? Well, it's no fun if it's not tight.

 You know what would be hot? Whipped cream. Oh, you are so

 bad. Oh, you have no idea. Yes, Edie Britt understood the nature

 of war. Edie, it's been ten minutes! Where's the damn whipped cream?

 She also knew that to the victor... Edie! Edie! ...go the spoils.

 The guest bedroom on the second floor of the Applewhite house had

 the best view in all of Wisteria Lane. From its windows, one

 could see from Mike Delfino's house on one end of the street,

 all the way to the old Huber place on the other. But

 unfortunately for the room's newest guest, the view was about to change...

 ...dramatically. What on earth is he doing out? Caleb, go to your

 room. Mom and I gotta have a talk now. His room? Have

 you lost your mind? Relax. I've taped newspapers to the windows. People

 can't see in. - Get back here. - We talked. He understands

 what will happen if he's discovered. For five seconds he understands and

 then he forgets. We can protect him without treating him like an

 animal. I am keeping him safe. From the police, from the Fosters,

 from himself... He is not going back downstairs! Since when do you

 talk to me like that? Since I share in the risk. I

 have a few announcements. I'd like to acknowledge Mrs Herbert for spearheading

 the potluck dinner. Her hard work and tuna melt... She's adorable, isn't

 she? She's OK. The Women's Ministry will... - Ours will be gorgeous.

 - Knock it off. - Knock what off? - Babies, babies, babies.

 You sound like a broken record. I just had a miscarriage. It'll

 take time before I'm ready to get pregnant again. Any idea when

 you'll be ready? Ballpark? Stop it! Let's just enjoy the here and

 now. We're together, our marriage is back on track, life is good.

 Before we wrap up, we have a dear friend back from her

 missionary trip to tell us about her experiences, Sister Mary Bernard. Son

 of a bitch! Danielle? - Honey, are you in there? - I'm

 doing homework. Really? I'm holding your backpack with all your books. Hold

 on. Thanks, Mom. I was doing a little research online. While I'm

 here I'll grab your laundry. - No, please, not right now. -

 Honey, stop complaining. One day you'll wish that someone were offering to

 do your laundry. Danielle, question. Is there a black man hiding under

 your bed? What's going on? I thought you should know that I

 found your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed. And it just seems

 to me that... Inside, right now. I apologise for my son's behaviour.

 It won't happen again. I put the house up for sale, and

 we're moving. Now, if you'll excuse me. - How's it going? -

 Oh, not good. I am trying to salvage the pitch from the

 Black's Frozen Yogurt campaign. - You know what kills me? - Yeah?

 Here we are at T minus nine hours and 11 minutes from

 the biggest pitch in our company's history, and I have nothing even

 vaguely presentable. - I'll get the coffee. - Thank you. So, you

 wanna... You wanna go over it and toss some ideas around? No,

 that's OK. I know you're exhausted. You should go to bed. Come

 on, honey. Let's do this, let's nail this sucker. What do we

 got? We've got nothing. OK, OK. \"Black's Frozen Yogurt: Let your taste

 buds come in from the cold.\" OK, whatever, I'm just knocking the

 rust off. I can do better than that. \"Black's: The fro-yo that

 makes you go whoa.\" Come on, I'm sorry, I just really need

 to focus here. \"Black's Frozen Yogurt: Because our cows are better.\" Or,

 no... Or, \"Frogurt. Frogurt! It's fun to eat, fun to say.\" -

 That's actually good. - Really? No, the cow part. That could work.

 We'II... We'll make them into characters, we'll humanise them and... Oh! I

 know! I know! Celebrity cow spokespeople. Yes! Yes! That's exactly what I

 was thinking. You know, like, make them into famous characters. Like... Reverend

 Moonie. What do you think of that? They can't all be gems.

 Oh. - Thank you, I had a fabulous time. - Me too.

 Well, I guess I better get going. Oh, well, Julie's staying at

 her father's house, - and I'm... I'm all alone here. - Oh.

 Yeah. Sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous. Turn the TV

 on. That's what I do. Oh, that's a good idea. I forgot,

 I have a bottle of wine. It's already chilled, right in the

 refrigerator, and that'll just really relax me. Right, that's good. So we're

 still good for Thursday? Yeah. Yeah, Thursday's great. So... ...good night. -

 Do I just repulse you? - No! Why? We've been on three

 dates, and you just keep acting like a perfect gentleman. And... ...it's

 getting a little old. - OK, make no mistake, I'm inches from

 ripping off your clothes right now. - And you're stopping yourself, why?

 - I'm still your doctor, and it's not quite ethical yet. -

 Oh. So why are we dating? - Look, it's only temporary. Once

 you're well and I'm done treating you, all bets are off. OK.

 - Oh, what the hell. - Oh... OK, that sort of felt

 unethical. Oh. - Thank you for meeting with me. - Sure. I'd

 have invited you into the house, but the place is a real

 pigsty. Carlos, I'm a nun, not a moron. I know Gabrielle despises

 me. She's just jealous of you, that's all. Of me? Well, isn't

 that silly. She refuses to believe that I can connect with anyone

 on a spiritual level. We do have an amazing connection. That's why

 I wanted to talk to you. When I saw you at church,

 I could tell instantly you were unhappy. OK. Maybe I have been

 a little down lately. Tell me. It's the whole having kids thing

 again. I... Sister Mary, I just... I want them so bad. Gabrielle

 still refuses to give them to you? To be fair, she did

 have a miscarriage recently. What if she decides against kids? - What

 if this is just a stall tactic? - Then I'm screwed. -

 Sorry. I'm sorry. - No, you're right. You're screwed. - Unless... -

 Unless what? \"An American Catholic's guide to annulments.\" What exactly are you

 saying? I'm saying, God helps those who help themselves. Hey, I got

 great news. We just landed the Black's Frozen Yogurt account. Really? They

 loved the pitch? The talking cows rocked their world. Hey, how did

 they like my President \"Bull\" Clinton idea? Well, I rewrote some of

 the stuff we worked on, but, you know, essentially it's the same,

 and they ate it up. Oh! That is fantastic. Yeah, and Ed

 said we can finally afford to hire another executive. Did they like

 the promotional plan sponsoring the cow-tipping contest? Well, the pitch was running

 long, so we cut a few things. - I'm just glad they

 loved my idea. - Well, to be fair... They like Hugh Heifer

 and the Playcows? They're calling me for a meeting. I gotta go.

 Love you. Bye. Yes. So this is your spleen. Normally, it'd be

 over here, but because you're missing ligament structure, it has wandered over

 there, right next to your liver. We discussed it at the staff

 meeting. Everyone thinks you should have it removed immediately. Oh, well, OK.

 I mean, I guess... I guess you guys probably have all sorts

 of new techniques where you don't even cut open the body. No,

 not really. No? So... ...we're talking surgery? Yeah, well, I guess I

 can handle that. People get cut open every day. I assume you're

 good with me doing the surgery? - You? - I mean, it

 seems natural. I know the most about your case. I promise you'll

 be in very good hands. Oh, well... What? The first time you'll

 see me naked, I'll be on an operating table. I'll be a

 perfect gentleman. My eyes will be strictly on the spleen. Doctor, Mrs

 Baker is here for her follow-up. Right. We need to schedule Susan

 for a splenectomy with me. Oh. Congratulations! So I will call you

 later. Oh, I am so happy for him. He's such a doll.

 I'm curious, why are you so congratulatory? Oh, the spleen surgery. It'll

 be his first. Hey, honey. - Can we talk about something? -

 Sure. So I've been thinking about the whole baby thing. And however

 long it takes for you to feel ready, I am fine with.

 - OK. - But here's the deal. I need to know that

 this isn't a maybe. I want a promise that we will have

 children. I'm sorry. I can't promise that. - Why not? - Because

 I can't say that I'm gonna wake up and suddenly want to

 do something that I swore my entire life I would never do!

 - \"Maybe\" is a big step for me. - It isn't big

 enough for me. I'm sorry, but you have to accept it. -

 There's nothing else you can do. - That isn't true. Excuse me?

 You are threatening me with an annulment? That conniving little bitch put

 you up to this, didn't she? - Didn't she? - This fight

 could be over now if you'd just make me a promise. The

 only promise I am making you is that this is so not

 over. - Hi. - Hey. Hi. How's the search coming for the

 new ad exec, any luck? Oh, the pickings are slim. So far

 none of my top choices are available. Hey, do you have someone

 from your old company that you could, you know, maybe recommend? Daddy,

 I can't find my toothbrush! - I'll be up in a second,

 buddy. - Hi. As a matter of fact, there's this one guy

 who'd be perfect. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hard-working, smart as a whip.

 - Total package. - Really? - What's his name? - Tom. -

 Tom. Tom what? - Tom Scavo. Oh! No. No, I do not

 think that that is a good idea. Doing those pitches got the

 old juices flowing. I remembered how much I miss having a real

 job. You have a real job. Right here. Staying home with the

 kids. With two incomes, we could afford a top-notch nanny. What about

 Penny? You fought for office day-care. What about the two of us

 working and living together? I think that could be a recipe for

 disaster. Why? The last time that we worked together... ...we fell in

 love. Oh, it's just, I'm... I'm not sure that you would find

 this job that satisfying. - You don't think I'm good enough. -

 I'm not saying that. Daddy, I still can't find my toothbrush. -

 I'll go. - I got it. Come on, buddy, let's hunt it

 down. So who won the fight? We weren't fighting, Mommy just let

 Daddy know where he stands. Oh! Hey! Hey! Thanks for coming in,

 Mr Gainey. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Bye. - What did

 you think? - I wasn't blown away. But we can't hold out

 much longer. We need to hire someone this week. I know, I

 know, I know. So who's up next? Tom Cavos. You ever heard

 of him? Could you excuse me for just a minute? Sure. -

 Tom Cavos? - Yeah. It's an anagram. - Deceptively simple, don't you

 think? - What are you doing? Going over your head. You might

 not think I'm good enough, but maybe Ed will be more open-minded.

 Since he's not constantly competing with me. You want the truth, Tom?

 I think you're good. You have moments of brilliance. But I also

 think sometimes you coast. And I think if I were your boss

 and had to ride your ass every day, you would come home

 seething with resentment. Come on. It's hard enough keeping a marriage together...

 If you're concerned about saving our marriage, you better let me take

 my shot. - What does that mean? - It means that a

 little part of me has been hating you ever since you tanked

 my promotion at Petersen. - Tom... - But I can let it

 all go if you'll give me this one thing. Excuse me, Ed's

 waiting for you guys. Great. Great. Just let my r?sum? speak for

 itself. - Just let your r?sum? speak for itself. - Yeah. OK.

 Oh! You worked the Poncer Cheese accounts? The \"Angry Mouse\" spots were

 hilarious! I was on that from the beginning. \"Warning: Do not eat

 the cheese. The cheese is evil.\" Love it! - You got a

 great r?sum?. - Thanks. Yeah, gosh, it is, it's quite impressive. Oh.

 Wow. I see you worked for Bellfore and Barrasso. That's a great

 shop. Yeah, I put my time in. And when were you there?

 You forgot to list your dates of employment for that one. That

 was a few years back. And... And how long did you stay?

 Just about five months, actually. You get recruited by another firm? Somebody

 cherry-pick you? - No, I was fired. - Oh. Honestly, I was

 happy to leave. They didn't get my sense of humour. I actually

 pitched a version of the \"cheese is evil\" there first. - They

 hated it. - Idiots. Well, their loss, right? You won a Clio

 for the Thompson's Salad Dressing spot. - That was very cool. -

 So did you do that solo? Actually, no, my wife helped me

 on that one. She's in advertising too. If you were to ask

 her, she'd tell you she did the whole thing all by herself.

 Credit hog, huh? I know the type. - You know what, Tom?

 I like you. - Ed... I'm not one for hiring in the

 room... No, no, no. We never hire in the room. ...but we're

 in a time crunch and need someone now. I think you're the

 guy. Lynette, you got any issues? Well, let me just call in

 a few references before we make anything official. Sure, sure. We'll be

 in touch, OK? \"The cheese is evil!\" God, I love that. Oh!

 Oh, I'm looking for Father Crowley, do you know where he is?

 He's in the confessional. How long has it been since your last

 confession? Who cares? Father, it's me. - Gabrielle? - Yeah. Look, I

 need you to do something for me. I need you to get

 rid of Sister Mary Bernard. - What? Why? - Because she's ruining

 my marriage! Sister Mary? Yes. It started with love letters while he

 was in prison. Next, they're spending day and night together, sneaking off

 to \"private\" bible study, and one-on-one spiritual consultation. - Gabrielle... - And

 if that wasn't enough, he is saying her name in his sleep!

 \"Hold me, Sister Mary! Hold me!\" It's disgusting, he's like a lovesick

 puppy! Well... Do you have reason to believe that your husband and

 Sister Mary are having sex? Speak from the heart, Gabrielle. This is

 just between me, you and God. Yeah. Yep, they're having sex. Carlos

 confessed everything, right before he asked for an annulment. Forgive me, Father,

 for I have sinned. How long since your last confession? Not that

 long ago. Look, I sort of told a fib, so how many

 Hail Mary's is that gonna set me back? - Oh, honey... -

 Go away! Oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault. There's no way

 I could have predicted how Betty would react. Oh, please. You knew

 something bad would happen. You wanted all this to blow up in

 my face. Oh, honey, why would I want that? Because you're jealous

 that my life's just getting started and yours is over. Danielle, that's

 ridiculous, sweetheart. Daddy's dead. You drove your boyfriend to suicide, you're getting

 older by the minute. Soon you'll be so dried up and bitter

 that no man will ever want to touch you ever again. -

 Danielle! - And now you're determined to ruin my life so I

 have to stay with you here and keep you company while you

 turn into an old fossil! All I ever wanted was for you

 to be happy. Don't just want it! Make it happen! Danielle, I

 don't feel much like cooking tonight. I'm thinking of ordering a pizza.

 I want Canadian bacon. Please. All right. He's mad at you. Because

 you hit him. Well, I feel bad about that. But when I

 consider the risks he was taking... It's a shame he can't see

 that girl. She's so pretty. What did you say about Danielle? I

 said that she... You know I don't want you thinking about things

 like that. I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK.

 Go on and run up to your room. Read the comics I

 got you. And, Caleb... ...if I ever catch you looking at that

 Van De Kamp girl, I'll hit you twice as hard as I

 hit your brother. And I won't feel bad about it. OK? OK.

 So this whole splenectomy thing, you feel good about it, huh? Yeah,

 I told you, it's a routine surgery. You're gonna be fine. Right,

 right. Actually, I sort of meant do you personally feel confident? What

 do you mean? Well, you know, you're gonna be... ...hacking into me,

 and I just wanted to make sure that you feel ready. I've

 never taken out a spleen before. But believe me, it's no big

 deal. Spleen, gallbladder, it's all the same. OK, red flag! I didn't

 go to medical school, but I'm thinking, not all the same. I

 know what I'm doing. You have to trust me. I would like

 to. But the fact that you can't cut that steak isn't helping.

 That's not fair. You overcooked it. It's not the freshest meat. Well,

 neither am I! I've got 35 years on that cow. Susan, are

 you saying you don't want me to be your surgeon? Well... I'm

 sorry. I don't mean this to sound the wrong way. I just...

 I would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon. That's OK. I

 understand. Thank you. I should really be going. What? You said you

 understood. I respect your decision to see another doctor. You need to

 respect that my feelings are hurt. What? You want me to put

 my life on the line to service your ego? I save lives

 every day. I cut, I save. I cut, I save. That's what

 I do. If that gives me an out-of-control ego, maybe I need

 that to cut into another human being. - Hey. - Hey. Dinner's

 ready. Oh. So did you call around? Check on my references? I

 told Ed you were my husband, and he was cool with that.

 He really wants to hire you. So who am I to stand

 in the way? - Really? So, I got the job? - On

 one condition. If you take this job, you are never allowed to

 bring up what happened before with your promotion. - That's it? Deal.

 - No, it's not a deal. I need a solemn vow that

 you will never throw that in my face ever again. Because if

 you do, you will unleash demons that you do not want to

 meet. I get it. And what I really need from you... ...is

 to be forgiven. Actually, I already had. - This dinner is really

 good. - Thank you. Thank you. - Hi, Betty. - Hello. I

 wanted to talk to you about what happened with the kids. I

 told you, we will be moving soon. There's nothing to worry about.

 Well, my fear is that if we keep them apart, they'll try

 that much harder to be together. You know how teenagers can be,

 and, well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks. I'll

 make a deal with you. If you control yours, I will control

 mine. How about some old-fashioned chaperoning? That way they can still see

 each other, and we won't have to be the villains. When it

 comes to my son's best interests, I'm not afraid of being the

 villain. I assumed that you would feel the same way, Bree. Now

 that you mention it, I guess I do. I have to go.

 I have some muffins in the oven. - Mom, what's wrong? -

 It's the Applewhites. - I don't want you to go near them.

 - What? Do you remember the man they arrested? The one that

 broke into Gabrielle's and escaped from the mental hospital? He's there. I

 saw him in their window. They're hiding him. - You're kidding. -

 No, I'm not. And I forbid you to go over there. Lynette,

 hi, it's Bree. Listen, call me when you get this and please

 come to poker tonight. I have some big news about the Applewhites.

 All right, bye. - Who was that? - Sister Mary. They just

 transferred her to a parish in Fairbanks, Alaska. - You're kidding me.

 Why? - She doesn't know. The diocese wouldn't give her a reason.

 Vatican politics. What's wrong? I think I'm just coming down with a

 migraine. Oh, well maybe you should go lie down, I'm gonna be

 out for a while. All right. I'll see you there. Susan. What

 are you doing here? - We need to talk. - OK. All

 right. - But look, I just got out of surgery... - I've

 been waiting for three hours. After you stormed out the other night,

 I started to doubt myself. I started to think, \"You know, maybe

 I should just ignore my better instincts, and I should let Dr

 Ron gut me like a fish.\" - Susan... - Why not? All

 my life, I have jumped through hoops to keep men from leaving.

 But I'm not doing it anymore. So tough luck, pally. You just

 missed out on a good thing. Susan! - You've been here for

 three hours? - Yeah. Two hours ago, flowers, champagne and an apology

 note were delivered to your doorstep. - Really? - Look, I put

 our relationship at risk, all right, and it was stupid. I haven't

 felt this way about somebody in a long time. Susan, I really

 like you. And because of that, I... I can't be your doctor,

 let alone your surgeon. I mean, there's a pretty good reason why

 they make those rules. I hope you forgive me. All right? Because

 I'll hate myself if I lose you. Wow. I wouldn't want you

 to hate yourself. No. And I am so sorry about that snap

 thing. I was just trying to be theatrical. Yeah. Got your note.

 What's going on? Are you hiding someone in your house? - What?

 - My mom saw someone in your second-storey window. She thinks it's

 the guy who broke into Mrs Solis'. - Damn it, Caleb! -

 Is that his name? She told anybody? She left messages on her

 friends' machines. They're coming over. - We'll have to leave tonight. -

 Why? What's going on? I would love to tell you. Believe me,

 I would. But I can't. If you trust me, I could help

 you. My family has secrets too. What my brother did, it's bad.

 Last year my brother did something really awful, and my parents covered

 it up for him. If anyone were to ever find out, Andrew

 and my mom could go to jail. So you don't have to

 worry about me judging you. Tell me your secrets. I'll understand. OK.

 But you tell me yours first. What are you doing here? I

 heard you were being transferred, so I came to say goodbye. Come

 to gloat is more like it. No. We've had our differences, but

 that doesn't mean I'm happy to see you shipped off to Alaska.

 You had something to do with this, didn't you? Me? Oh, I'm

 just a humble sinner. You're the one with all the power around

 here, all the annulment mojo. Is that why you did it? Well,

 getting rid of me isn't going to change anything. Carlos will do

 what he wants. The problems in your marriage aren't going away. Maybe

 not. But you certainly are. You missed a spot. Oh! That was

 a mistake. There. I think we're all done here. Oh, my God!

 Oh, my God! Hold on! Are you OK? Ladies! Stop right now!

 I said, stop fighting! Stop! No! What the hell were you thinking?

 It depends. What have you heard? I got a call from the

 church. They said you attacked Sister Mary. - Yeah. That's about right.

 - What are you thinking? I wasn't. But I was thinking about

 it on the way over here, and I realised the ass I

 should be kicking is yours. - Mine? - Yes. Sister Mary manipulated

 you into threatening me. But you're the idiot that fell for it.

 I was not threatening you. I was asking for a promise. You

 made me a promise, Carlos, a long time ago: \"Till death do

 us part.\" And one day you just come home and start throwing

 words around like \"annulment\". How do you think that makes me feel?

 OK. I'm sorry about that. I need to have a child. And

 I need to know I'm the woman you want to spend the

 rest of your life with. Not just some uterus in high heels.

 - Gabrielle, please... - No! Carlos, I am sorry, I am not

 going to be blackmailed into giving birth. You have to choose. And

 I wish you would do it so I can move on with

 my life. Well, of course I choose you. I think that's the

 right decision. You know, I made a decision too. The answer to

 your question earlier is \"yes\". Yes? I want to have a baby.

 I want to have a baby with you. Betty. What a surprise.

 Can I talk to you for a moment? Now is actually not

 a good time for me. I think it is. I wanted to

 chat with you before you did something foolish. I don't know what

 you mean. The person you saw in my house today is my

 other son. His name is Caleb. He didn't harm Gabrielle. He didn't

 hurt the man in the car trunk. That's all you need to

 know. - He's your son? - He's my dear son. Who happens

 to be slow. Sometimes he makes mistakes. But, Betty, the police are

 looking for him, he escaped from that facility they sent him to.

 He had help, trust me. I've always thought the maternal instinct is

 one of nature's most amazing gifts. I mean, the lengths that some

 mothers will go to protect their children. It drives ordinary women to

 do extraordinary things. Women like me, Bree. And like you. What are

 you talking about? If you breathe one word of Caleb's existence to

 anyone, I will tell Carlos, Gabrielle, and the police that it was

 your son driving the car that killed Juanita Solis. And that you

 have been covering up his crime ever since. We're going to be

 great friends, Bree. We have so much in common. - So was

 that all she said? - Yeah. Something about the Applewhites. I'm dying

 of curiosity. It's rude to keep people waiting. Hi. Come on in.

 So spill it. What's the scoop on the Applewhites? About that... Oh,

 Bree, come on, dish already! Well, perhaps I got more excited than

 I should have, but I recently found out that Betty Applewhite is

 quite the poker player. And so I have invited her to join

 our weekly game. Hello, everybody. I hope you brought your chequebooks, because

 I am feeling lucky. Everyone understands the nature of war. I raise.

 We also understand that victory depends on the cards that we have

 been dealt. Some, when faced with a bloody battle, simply give in.

 But for some, surrender is unacceptable. Well, Bree? What are you gonna

 do? Even though they know it will be a fight... I'll raise
