 ":"Previously...

 You're marrying him for his money? Lynette had reservations about her mother's

 marriage. You can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that. Susan began her

 wait for a kidney donor. - I'm going on a wait list.

 - It takes years. Bree found out that Keith had a son

 but decided not to tell him... Keith feels that it would be

 too difficult for everyone. Easing her guilt with a check. Get out

 of the car! Gaby's obsession with her doll... Nearly cost her life.

 It's not Grace. And paul recognized the gun that was used to

 shoot him. Paul young had a son, but he had not seen

 Zach in years. He had lost him to a world of fast

 women... Easy money... And hard drugs. Paul had lost his son... but

 he was determined to find him. And he would do anything... even

 if that meant asking for help... from a man who despised him.

 - What the hell are you doing here? - I need a

 favor. - From me? - I know. You hate me, and I

 hate you. We're done with our traditional greeting can I tell you

 what I want? - Yeah, go ahead. - I need to find

 Zach. I went to that mansion his grandfather left him. - It's

 in foreclosure. - I heard about that. Do you know where he

 went? I don't know where he is. And even if I did,

 why would I do you any favors? Zach's the one who shot

 me. The police showed me the gun. It was the same one

 Mary Alice used to kill herself. And Zach kept it? He's always

 been a strange boy. If you really think he tried to kill

 you, why didn't you tell the police? I'd like to keep this

 in the family. So again, where is he? Last I heard, Idaho.

 If you hear from him, tell him I know what he did...

 and I'm very disappointed. Though he didn't admit it, Mike knew exactly

 where Zach was, but the son Paul Young had lost... had no

 interest in being found. Par la Wisteria Team www.wisteria-team.fr www.sous-titres.eu It doesn't

 matter where we're going. It doesn't matter how quickly we try to

 get there. It doesn't matter that we never look back. The past

 we left behind will still find a way to catch up to

 us. I'm making grilled salmon. Why did you get a pizza? Because

 you're making grilled salmon. I wish you wouldn't put that terrible food

 in your body. It's not good. You know you want a bite.

 Eat it. Seriously, I have better-tasting food under my refrigerator. - I'm

 sorry to bother you. - No bother. Look, I'm outside. I need

 to talk to you. No, don't come over. I'll come to you.

 See you soon. I need to run to Lynette's for a minute.

 Do you mind waiting for dinner? Hurry up. I'm starved. So the

 bank says your check is gonna take five days to clear. Is

 there any way you can get me a cashier's check? - I

 really need to pay some bills. - Absolutely. There's a restaurant across

 from the bank. I can meet you there tomorrow at 2:00. That'll

 be great. Thank you again, Bree. Bree, wait. I know Keith doesn't

 wanna meet Charlie. But he should at least know what his son

 looks like. I'm sure he'll appreciate that. So according to the donor

 database, I will be waiting three to four years. Where does that

 put me on the list? - Is there a number? - There

 is no number. It all boils down to your D.N.A. And how

 long you've been waiting. So, you have your beeper. Four years is

 a long time. From Fairview High. I sat behind you in chem

 lab. I was yearbook photographer? Now I sell pharmaceutical supplies. I friended

 you on Facebook, like, 12 times. I guess I didn't get them.

 No worries. Tell me, what's new? How are you? I need a

 kidney transplant. I'm gonna be spending the next three to four years

 on dialysis three times a week, five hours a day. I didn't

 know. Then again, if you'd friended me... I'll see you at the

 reunion... If I'm still alive. You like? Frank gave them to me.

 - They belonged to my first wife. - She's dead. Isn't that

 a little weird? This necklace belonged to his second wife, and she's

 sitting right over there. That's weird. I have to admit, you two

 seem very happy together. Tell her about Saturday. What about Saturday? Frank

 wants you to bring Tom and the kids back up here. I

 wanna take a family portrait. Family is very important to Frank. And

 since my first three families aren't speaking to me, I wanna get

 this one right, so I can rub it in their miserable faces.

 That's a sweet thought, but Saturdays are kind of crazy for us.

 Penny's got ballet, Parker's studying for the S.A.T.S. How about I make

 it worth your while? You're bribing me? Call it gas money if

 it'll make you feel any better. Will $500 do it? I'm not

 taking his money. Frank, isn't it time for your heart medicine? Look

 how she takes care of me. Do what you have to do

 to make this work. But I'm not going over a grand. What

 are you doing? I just married the man. He's in the process

 of redoing his will, so we've gotta play ball. I am not

 gonna bend over backwards just to please that jerk. You're the one

 who married him, not me. I can't tell Frank no. But I

 can tell you no. So if you want the picture, you can

 come to our house. Fine. I'll talk to him. Will you stop

 staring at this necklace? You are not getting it back! So the

 fashion show ends, and Yves Saint Laurent... who doesn't swim, by the

 way... rents a yacht for the after-party. And that's where I met

 Mick Jagger. Do you have any wine? We don't really do wine

 in therapy. You should. A few glasses, and you'd have your patients

 whining about how daddy didn't love 'em in half the time. Did

 your father not love you? I was joking. My dad was great.

 He died when I was a kid. That must have been hard...

 growing up without a male presence? No. She remarried. I forgot to

 tell you the best part of the Jagger story. He read my

 palm. And he told me I would be going below deck to

 have sex with him. Not only is he a great singer, he's

 an amazing psychic. Why don't you like talking about your childhood? What's

 the point? The past is the past. Sometimes what happens to us

 in the past affects who we are today. By the way, Jagger,

 big cuddler. Come on. We're gonna have to go deeper here. Well,

 that's the thing about me-there is no deeper. Ask any of my

 friends. I'm the shallowest person they know. I'm just skin, a little

 blood, and stories about Keith Richards drinking out of my shoes. You

 don't have to be afraid. Let's talk about your childhood. I love

 therapy. - Really? - Yeah. It's like a talk show Where I'm

 the guest, the only topic is me. So it's helping? You talked

 to her about the doll? That is confidential. First rule of therapy.

 First rule of therapy is no wine, but I'm gonna change that.

 I'm so glad this is working. I've been worried about you. It's

 exactly what I needed. In fact, I'm gonna be going three times

 a week. Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays. That's a lot. It was your

 idea. By the way... you're gonna have to take over my carpools

 on Mondays. That's okay? Sure. I guess I could move some things

 around. And no golf on Thursdays, because you'll have to take Juanita

 to ballet. Gaby, I do business on the links. Do you want

 me to get better or not? Okay. I will cancel golf. And

 on Friday, I have a gynecologist appointment. That I need you to

 cancel. Wouldn't that be great, though? I see you brought Charlie. I

 don't have anyone to watch him. I have your cashier's check. Thank

 you again, Bree. - Honey, let's go. - No. I haven't finished

 my pizza. Let's go. Do you mind keeping an eye on him?

 The bank is right across the way. I'll only be ten minutes.

 - I don't know. - Just order some pizza. It'll be on

 me. I'm gonna play games. Much better than conversation. - My beeper

 went off. Does that mean - Yes, we found you a donor.

 But how? You said it would probably take years. The rules change

 if someone wants to donate a kidney to a specific individual. Wait.

 Someone I know? Apparently. He's in my office right now signing the

 paperwork. It's a he? I'm getting a man kidney? Not that I'm

 complaining. You're my donor? Turns out I'm a match. What are the

 odds, huh? - I don't know what to say. - I'm giving

 you a vital organ. How about \"thank you\"? Why would you do

 this? We haven't seen each other in years, and... I barely remembered

 you. I remembered you. You were really wonderful to me in high

 school. And you're in trouble, and I wanna help. So what's a

 guy gotta do to get a hug? Give you a lung? Come

 here, you! Please know you've made me very happy. I'm so glad.

 Busted. I'm on my way to Mrs. Goodman's place to finish that

 job and what do I see? Your car, parked in front of

 a pizza joint. - About that... - Admit it. You're hooked. What

 are you, a deep-dish girl? Thin crust? You got me. I am

 a closet pizza lover. Mystery solved. You can go to your job

 now. I need more quarters. Who's this? What do you got, some

 secret boyfriend? This is Charlie. I'm, uh, watching him for a friend

 of mine. I'm sorry, I don't have any more change. Now, could

 you excuse us? You got quarters? I got some. Come on. What

 about Mrs. Goodman? She's lived without a screen door for 30 years.

 She can wait an half hour. All right. Let's see what you

 got. I'm gonna show you something. But this is just between you

 and me. Hand... In the cookie jar. Bang. Let's see it. High

 five. That was a good one. Let's see it again. One more.

 Step-back jumper fadeaway. Nice one. Are you kiddin' me? One more, I'm

 calling the NBA. - That was awesome. - Did you see that?

 Three in a row. I certainly did. It was wonderful. Charlie, I

 gotta take off. Nice meeting you. See you later. Remember me when

 you're on the Lakers. They're here! Frank drives a Bentley. Of course

 he does. Why are we taking this stupid picture? I mean, we

 barely even know the guy. It's for your grandma. And the lovely

 man she just married. Hello! Welcome! - Hello, everybody! - Hey, grandma.

 So, this really is where they live. I thought you were kiddin'.

 How was the drive over, Frank? It took forever. We got behind

 this Asian woman driver, slow as soy sauce going uphill in winter.

 Okay. Small talk's over. Let's take the picture. We were all thinking

 we'd sit over here. I don't wanna see your crappy kitchen in

 the background there. Let's move this sofa over there. I want it

 to be real homey. Cagney and Lacey, grab this end of the

 couch. What are you doing? You can't just walk into people's houses

 and move furniture around. When it looks like this, you can. No.

 Put it back. It's bad enough you make me drive all the

 way out here to east podunk. Well, bull! I want my picture,

 my way! Whatever you say. That's too heavy. You're all red. That's

 'cause the girls here were not much help. Come and take your

 place around... Grandpa Frank. Here we go. Everybody smile and say \"Bentley\".

 Okay. Nobody move. I wanna check that it's good. Hang on. We

 have to do it again. Frank, your eyes are closed. What's wrong?

 He's dead. Of course he is. There's no pulse. No pulse. He's

 definitely dead. Is his ghost gonna be trapped in our house? Is

 he gonna haunt us? No, honey. Of course not. Gross. A dead

 guy's on our couch. And I'm having friends over. How long till

 he starts to smell? Go upstairs. There's nothing to see here. What

 are you talking about? There's a dead body. That's totally something to

 see. Come on. Let's go. Upstairs. Come on. Mom, I'm so sorry.

 I can't believe he's gone. Just like that. I know. What are

 you doing? I'm calling the police so they can get a coroner

 over here. Hang on. You can't call them yet. - Why not?

 - That new will I told you about... the one leaving everything

 to me? It doesn't go into effect until tomorrow. You want me

 to keep him here? Like that? All night? If we call the

 coroner now, I get nothing. If we call in the morning... millions.

 I didn't want Frank in my house when he was alive. Now

 you want me to hang out with his corpse? Then throw a

 sheet over him and spray a little air freshener. You won't even

 notice. Frank wanted me to have that money. No! It's too weird!

 You wouldn't have to take care of me anymore. In fact, I

 could even take care of you. College tuition? Braces? It would make

 me feel so good to be able to help you for a

 change. It's been a long time, son. Yeah, I guess. How's it

 going? I couldn't be better. What can I do for ya? Wait.

 Let me guess. You want money. I nailed it, didn't I? But

 you can see, a lot of other people... they got here first.

 Sorry to hear that. Who cares? It's time to downsize, minimize my

 carbon footprint. - You feeling okay, buddy? - I feel great. Sounds

 like you're the one having problems. Susan and I are going through

 a rough time, like a lot of people. So how screwed are

 you? We had to rent out our house... to your father, in

 fact. My father's in prison. He's out. You didn't know? - You

 sure you're okay? - That bastard gets to walk free after everything

 that he did! I didn't mean to upset you. It's okay. Just...

 Could you leave? I need to be alone. Just... You never sneak

 up behind someone when they're staring at a dead person! I'm sorry.

 It's just... your scream... it was like all the testosterone left your

 body at once. This whole thing creeps me out. It's just... a

 body. How do you become this guy? 9 kids, 14 grandchildren, and

 you never talk to any of them. That's the tricky thing about

 money. Changes people. Changes relationships. It sure does. And after you're dead,

 what's it all mean? Not funny. Hi. This is Maria. I'm calling

 to confirm Gabrielle Solis for her 1:00 appointment. - Yep. She's on

 her way. - Terrific. You wouldn't happen to know what kind of

 treatment she wants today? I don't know. Whatever you've been doing seems

 to be working. On Monday she got the seaweed wrap, Wednesday the

 hot stone massage. We just want to make sure she takes full

 advantage of our entire spa menu. She is taking full advantage, all

 right. Good, Sandro. There you are. I think we should start on

 my shoulders today. That's good. Maybe a little lighter on the pressure.

 No, no. Lighter. Maybe let's not do the shoulders. How about the

 glutes? Carlos, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be in

 therapy. This is therapy! Didn't you see the sign? \"Massage therapy\", \"Aromatherapy\".

 I talked to Dr. Wyner. You haven't been back since the first

 session. Why not? I just don't think I really need it. This

 is really helping. This is ignoring the problem. You know, the way

 you say \"Problem\", you make it seem a whole lot worse than

 it actually is. Gaby, you almost got us killed pulling a doll

 out of the car. Fine. If it'll get you off my ass,

 I'll make an appointment for next week. Now get your clothes on.

 We're leaving. God, now I'm so tense. I'll give you 100 bucks

 if you work on my shoulders for ten minutes. That's for free.

 Let's go. He came downstairs just after midnight to watch some TV,

 and we didn't find him until this morning. In that case, I'll

 just put down time of death around 3:00 A.M. Would you like

 us to bring the body directly to the funeral home? Yes, thank

 you. Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss. My god. I'm rich!

 Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss. I know. I spent some

 of the best weeks of my life with Frank. But he's gone,

 there's nothing we can do about it, and I am a millionaire.

 Good. You can buy me a new couch. - I'll buy you

 whatever you want. - I was kidding. Well, I wasn't. What do

 you need? Anyone. - I need a laptop for school. - Done.

 Can I have a motorcycle? - For school? - Kids, knock it

 off. Frank's body's not even in the van yet. Actually, it is.

 I don't care. We're not talking about money right now. A man

 died, not a bank account. A man. Let's show a little respect.

 We should probably figure out what to do about that Bentley. Anybody

 here? It's me! Sorry. It's a rough neighborhood. You know how it

 is. Two visits in one year. What's up? Would you mind sitting

 down? We need to talk. Do we? Sure, just... in a minute.

 Who you looking for, Zach? Your father? Paul came to see me.

 He thinks you shot him. That true? Okay. I shot him. He

 ruined my life, but he gets to start his over. It didn't

 seem right. It was easy. I practiced it in my head over

 and over again, and then... Showtime. But then I got all paranoid

 and I dumped the stupid gun at Bree's. I don't know what

 I was thinking with that one. I wasn't thinking. That's the problem

 with being high. You do things without thinking. I'm not using drugs.

 I've been there. You need help. - We got to get you

 into rehab. - You want to send me to rehab? So my

 father can come and find me and take me to prison? No

 way. I want to get you some help. It's too late for

 you to pretend to be my father. - But I still care.

 - Then why did you let me go? You let me get

 raised by that monster. That's not how things happened. - I don't

 care. - Let me help you... Just get out my house. Get

 out! It's really nice of you to have me over. Are you

 kidding? I am gonna spend the rest of my life thinking of

 ways to thank you. But as a start... Really? Oh, come on.

 That is so sweet. A crystal heart. I looked for a crystal

 kidney- Surprisingly hard to find. In high school I always dreamt you'd

 give me your heart. You know, speaking of high school, I have

 a present for you, too. In addition to the one that's being

 ripped out of your body? - Sorry. That was a little too

 vivid. - No, that's all right. Here you go. What is this?

 It's just some memorabilia that I'd thought you'd enjoy. Some photos I

 took that didn't make the cut for the yearbook. There I am

 on the field hockey team... And in Pippin. These are great. Who

 else do you have in here? Oh, there's me on the debate

 club... And me at the spring formal... Me in a bathing suit...

 Taken through a fence. Not easy to get. Those bushes around your

 yard were really thick. Is this one of my old english papers?

 Yeah, you threw it away, and I fished it out of the

 garbage. That's also where I found this. Here. My retainer? I would

 have returned it, but I was too scared to talk to you.

 Isn't it funny how we're talking now? Yeah, really funny. And now...

 We're gonna be bonded... You know... Forever. If you told me back

 in high school that one day my kidney would be cleansing Susan

 Bremer's blood, I would have been the happiest guy on Earth. Well,

 I'm glad I could make that happen for you. Here. Why don't

 you go see what's shaking at the malt shop? Thanks, grandma. What's

 all this? A little thank you for all the help you've been

 the last few days. Open it, open it. Wow, it's beautiful. 2,200

 bucks. Didn't bat an eye. - That's a lot of money. -

 There's more where that came from. Why don't you and the whole

 fam-damily come for dinner Sunday night? I thought you were coming here

 Sunday. I was gonna send a kid to pick you up. It's

 better you come to me. But Sunday's a school night, Tom's got

 an early meeting Monday. Saturday? Nah. Sunday. Oh, heads up. Dinners at

 the center are fancy. You'll have to squeeze your boys into some

 jackets and ties. Are you not listening? It's not gonna work for

 us. I would think you would want to make it work, Lynette...

 Given everything I'm gonna be doing for the family. Are you blackmailing

 me? I'm inviting you to dinner. If you can't make it, I

 can ask one of your sisters. No, cover your man. Come on.

 Hey, babe. Game's almost over. Are you kidding me? You okay? I'm

 sorry. I should have given this to you before. Why are you

 giving me a picture of the kid from the pizza place? He's

 your son. I still can't get over this. You run into some

 random classmate from high school, and he's gonna end up saving your

 life? Here's the part I can't get over. You never put out

 for this guy? No, I barely remember him. Monroe is just doing

 this incredibly selfless act of charity. It's inspiring. What's this? Nothing. Just

 put that away. It's got your name on the cover in glitter.

 No, it's just a gift from Monroe. Can I please have that?

 You used to be cute. What happened? No, there's like, a million

 pictures of you in here. I guess he had a little crush

 on me. Crush? This Monroe guy's obsessed with you. This is a

 shrine. - It is not. - It is. I know. I've made

 them. I can't mail things to Seacrest anymore. It's creepy. Like that

 movie when they go to the guy's basement in front of the

 picture of the woman he's gonna kill. Those guys are often misunderstood.

 You're gonna take a kidney from him? Okay, I admit, I'm a

 little concerned. Yes, he may be 5% stalker. Is this a lock

 of your hair? 10% stalker. But if I don't take his kidney,

 I could wait another six years. Why shouldn't I? Because you'll be

 forever connected to him. You'll never get rid of him. And I

 have a feeling that's not the only organ he wants to... share

 with you. Carlos, can you feel my forehead? - I think I

 have a fever. - You're fine. - You didn't even feel! -

 'cause I don't need to. Liar. No, I'm really sick. Let's reschedule.

 I shouldn't see the therapist today. - We're going in. - What

 if I need to throw up? It's a therapist. You're supposed to

 get it all out. You are going to therapy, and that's all

 there is to it. Can I at least go to the bathroom

 first? My bladder is the size of a dime. - How many

 years have we been married? - Too many, if you ask me!

 - Where are you going? - Home. Gaby, you are sick. You

 need help. Look, you want me take pills, I will take them.

 To see a hypnotist? Bring him to the house. Hell, I'll even

 let you hire a priest to do an exorcism. But what I

 am not going to do is talk to that woman in there.

 Why not? Because she wants to talk about my childhood! Can I

 say one thing? You found a way to talk about it before.

 With me. Just that once. We had gotten married. I thought you

 had a right to know. You never wanted to talk about it

 again, and I have respected that. But over the years, I have

 seen what it costs you. The nights I hear you crying in

 the bathroom... Sad look on your face when people ask about your

 past... You think that you've left it behind, but you haven't, Gaby.

 You carry that burden around with you. I just want you to

 consider the idea that this therapist might be able to help you

 let all that go. Can you come with me? So when I

 lost Grace, it tapped into this need I have to protect children.

 Where do you think this need came from? 'cause no one protected

 me. When I was a child, my stepfather molested me. - Get

 in. - Why would I do that? I know where Zach is.

 Are we driving to Idaho? Look, the reason I didn't tell you

 where he was before is I didn't know what you wanted to

 do to him. But whatever it is, it can't be worse than

 what he's doing to himself. And why should I care about that

 after he tried to kill me? He's your son. He's my son.

 He needs our help. Hey, neighbor. What do you mean, \"neighbor\"? Your

 landlady's showing me an apartment. Now that we're back in each other's

 lives, it would be better if I lived close. Here's the thing

 about that. There's close... And then there's Glenn Close. This feels a

 little... Stalky. Stalky? I'm giving you a kidney. Monroe, come with me.

 The other day, when you were over here, I did not give

 you the full story. This is Mike. He is my husband. And

 this is our son MJ. Okay. Why are you showing me this?

 Because I want you to see that there isn't room for anyone

 else in that picture. Don't get me wrong. I am so grateful

 that you want to give me a kidney. But once the operation

 is over, that has to be it. - Why? - Because... You

 want to be more than friends, and I'm married. The tricky part

 is that... I still need a kidney... 'cause I want to stay

 healthy for... the two special guys in that picture. So if you...

 still want to give me one... no strings attached, I will be

 honored to take it. And you will have my eternal gratitude. Yeah,

 but that's all I'll have. What do you say? I can't. I

 thought if I did this, then you would finally... I know. I'm

 so sorry. Don't be. I'll be fine. I guess I'll see you

 around. Actually, I guess I won't. We may think we've left the

 past behind, but it has a way... of catching up to us.

 Though we want to run away, we are forced to confront our

 past. And the secrets that it buried... must come into the light.

 And then, if we are strong, we are able to move on.

 We all need to leave the past behind and move on toward

 the future. And if we're lucky, we will have help getting there."}
