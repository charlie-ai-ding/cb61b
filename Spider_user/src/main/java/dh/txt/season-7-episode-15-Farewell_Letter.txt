 ":"MARY

 ALICE: Previously on Desperate Housewives. Beth had no idea Paul was told

 the truth about her mother. Felicia Tillman has gone to some extraordinary

 lengths to cause you harm. In therapy, Gabby confronted her past. When

 I was a child my stepfather molested me. Bree made a stunning

 revelation. He's your son. And two fathers... He needs our help. ...

 reached out to a son in trouble. Lynette Scavo had lost a

 lot of sleep over the years. There had been 3:00 a.m. Feedings.

 Temperatures of 102. And late-night pillow fights. But Lynette had never complained,

 because a mother... PORTER: Mom? ... is always on call. Do we

 have any eggs? Yes, we have eggs. Where do we keep them?

 In the refrigerator. Cool, thanks. How do you make an omelet? You

 don't have to come down. Just tell us where the stuff is.

 No, it's just easier if I do it myself. Two omelets coming

 up. Actually, could you make mine an egg white scramble? Girls? Hello.

 Mom, this is Tiffany and Kimberly. We met them at a keg

 party, wandering around, looking for food. Somebody scarfed all the chips and

 stuff. And we were like, wouldn't it be awesome to have Denver

 omelets right now? 'Cause I'm from Denver. Really? I'm getting more of

 a Vegas vibe. Sidebar? You woke me up to cater your booty

 call? Mom, this isn't a booty call. I think you mean a

 \"hookup.\" A booty call is, like, when you're feeling horny and you

 pick up the phone... Okay, I got it. Look, this isn't a

 frat house, this is our family home and you can't bring your

 whatevers here to seal the deal. Why not? We've been doing it

 for months. Mom. We're not kids anymore. Yeah, we're grown men. Old

 enough to vote. Old enough to die for our country. Now where

 do we keep the eggs? Under the sink, next to the fresh

 fruit. Thanks. Yes, Lynette Scavo had lost a lot of sleep over

 the years, and she was getting tired of it. There are all

 sorts of ways to leave. Some people shake hands. Others offer a

 gentle wave. A few like to give big hugs. Then there are

 those who refuse to leave until someone else says, \"Get out.\" Morning,

 boys. Why are you handing me classified ads? You have seven days

 to find another place to live. Whoa! Whoa! You're kicking us out?

 You said I could stay here until I finished college. Yeah, we're

 starting to think that's not going to happen. Guys, please don't do

 this. We like it here. Of course you do. You think doing

 laundry is throwing dirty clothes in the hamper and getting clean ones

 out of the drawer. That's how Dad does it. Okay. Let's stay

 on topic. Guys, you need to grow up. Learn to be independent.

 And that's going to start with you getting your own place. And

 how are we going to pay for it? If you turn that

 paper over, you'll find a whole section of people willing to exchange

 money for something called work. We have to get jobs? This is

 crazy! You guys are acting like we stabbed you last night. Oh,

 obviously you didn't do that. You don't know where the knives are.

 Now start making some calls. (EXHALING) You really think that they're ready?

 No. And that's why we have to do this. Those boys are

 drifting through life, Tom. If we don't do something soon, we'll have

 twin 50-year-olds living in the basement screaming upstairs for juice. You're right.

 Unless we push them out of the nest, they'll never learn to

 fly. Mmm-hmm. Do you have to dial a \"1\" before the area

 code? And the first chick lands with a thud. Yes, I've been

 on hold for, like, four miles. I just got a notice that

 my insurance is only covering partial payment of my dialysis. No. That

 can't be right. I can't afford that, and I need treatments three

 times a week... (EX CLAIMING) Damn it. Not you. I just ruined

 my shirt and saved a chipmunk's life in the same move. -

 This is not a good day. - (SIREN WAILING) Oh, crap. Morning,

 ma'am. Do you know why I pulled you over? To commend me

 for saving that chipmunk's life? No. You didn't come to a complete

 stop at that stop sign on Ferndale. License and registration, please. I'm

 sorry, I guess I was just really distracted. I was trying to

 talk to the insurance company and then the coffee spilled. And now

 I'm going to be late for my dialysis appointment, which means that

 all the good chairs will be taken and I will end up

 in the chair by the bathroom and I will spend the next

 six hours listening to people flush. Dialysis? Man, that must be rough.

 Yeah, and explains why I look a lot more bloated than I

 do on my license. Look, I don't want you to be late

 for your appointment. I'll let you off with a warning. Oh. Really?

 - Good luck, ma'am. - Thank you. And thank you, dialysis. (SIGHING)

 I don't want to go on this stupid trip. It's only 24

 hours. Okay. Trust me, 24 hours in my hometown feels like two

 years. Those people are small-minded, they're bigoted, and their teeth... It's the

 land orthodontia forgot. Well, it produced you, so it can't be all

 bad. (GROANS) Please. You know what that town is famous for? The

 second-longest-burning tire fire in America. Gabby, I think we both know why

 you don't want to go. And it's not about the town. (SIGHING)

 Okay, you're right. But I don't care what my therapist says. I

 don't want to fly to Texas to stand on some dead guy's

 grave and read him a letter. That dead guy was your stepfather.

 And he abused you. When Dr. Wyner told you to write down

 how you felt, that helped, didn't it? I guess. Well, then I

 really think you should listen to her when she says that reading

 it at his grave will help. Confronting him will give you closure.

 He's dead! Can't I just confront him from the comfort of my

 own home, with a glass of wine and an Ouija board? If

 you absolutely don't want to do this, you don't have to. But

 I really wish you would. Fine. Twenty-four hours. One graveside rant, and

 then we come home. Why are you bringing evening wear? It's the

 anniversary of the tire fire. There's going to be a party. We're

 almost there, Zach. These people are going to be able to help

 you. (GROANING) I don't need to go to rehab. Tell that to

 the puke on my shoes. Thank God your mother never saw you

 like this. Easy, Paul. You can't make me go. Zach, face it.

 You're going. (PANTING) Okay. I will. I promise. Tomorrow. Just let me

 out now. Let go of me. I'm trying to help you. You?

 You... You did this to me. You're the reason I'm like this.

 You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Paul, ignore him.

 He's sick. I'm not sick! He's sick! I'm fine. - You're fine?

 - Ow! You shot me. You shot your own father. Does that

 sound \"fine\" to you? Paul! Paul, let him go. You're going to

 rehab. You're going to take these drugs and flush them out of

 you, and then we're gonna talk. Or I swear I will drive

 your sorry ass to prison myself. So, you can either dry out

 in rehab, or take your chances in jail. I'm good either way.

 (EXHALING) Let's go. You want just the top. Tip of your fingers

 right there on the seam, right? Yeah. There. Then when you throw

 the ball, you whip your hand down, right? It gets the... It

 gets it spinning faster. Let's give it a shot. Really whip those

 fingers. Ow! Take it easy! Charlie, it's time to go. No, Mom.

 Please? Five more minutes. Sorry, sweetie, we have to get back to

 the hotel and start packing. Hey, you heard your mom. I'll see

 you in the morning. Okay? Plus, I need to ice down this

 hand. I can't believe they're flying back to Florida tomorrow. I know.

 I wish you'd had a chance to spend more time with him.

 Yeah, I wish that, too. Unfortunately, we lost a week while you

 decided whether or not to tell me they were here. Yes. And

 again, I am so sorry. That's my son. How could you keep

 him from me? What were you thinking? I'm not proud of what

 I did. But I didn't want to lose you. Don't make it

 sound romantic. What you did was unbelievably selfish. I know. If this

 relationship is gonna have any future at all, we have to at

 least be honest with each other. I feel terrible. Just please don't

 be angry. I am angry. But mostly at this... At this crappy

 situation. You and me, I'm sure that we'll get past this. Mom,

 this is taking forever. Tom & Jerry's on in 10 minutes. I

 know, honey. You promised we'd be home. MJ, what do you want

 me to do? I can't make these people disappear. You promised. (SIGHS)

 I forgot foil. Will you go get me a roll? Excuse me,

 I know you're all probably in a hurry, but would you mind

 if I went in front of you? You see, I have my

 dialysis appointment and if I'm late, I start to get a little

 weak. You poor thing. Bless you. My aunt is on dialysis. Well,

 my defective little kidney and I thank you both. All right! We're

 gonna get to see Tom & Jerry! Tom is my doctor, Jerry's

 his nurse. And when I'm late, boy, they really go at each

 other. So this is it. Yep. I was wrong. It can be

 worse than I remembered. It's not that bad. Really? Because when we

 asked the cabbie to turn left at the burned-out car, he said,

 \"You're gonna have to be a little more specific.\" Uh-oh. Get out

 a couple of singles. You look lost. I take it you folks

 aren't from around here. Yes and no. Mostly no. Wait a minute,

 you're not Gabrielle Marquez, are you? Yes. Do I know you? No,

 but I know you from all those magazines! You're a supermodel! Welcome

 back! Well, thank you. Looks like the old place hasn't changed a

 bit. Sounds like someone hasn't seen the new stoplight yet. So, what

 brings you back to town? We should check in to the hotel.

 Nice meeting you, lady. Hotel? I thought we were going to the

 cemetery first. It's been a long trip, Carlos. I just want to

 lie down for a few minutes. (SIGHING) So? Was the flight on

 time? Yeah. The one time I'm begging for an eight-hour delay and

 they leave the gate three minutes early. Keith. (EXHALING) Three days ago,

 I didn't even know that this kid existed. And now I don't

 know how I'm going to live without him. He's a wonderful little

 boy. Yeah. Yeah, he is. You know, my whole childhood, my dad

 was in the army. He'd be gone for six, or seven months

 at a clip, and then back for two weeks, and gone again.

 I always swore that I would never do that to my kid.

 And guess what? Here I am. Keith, you are not your father.

 I actually said to Charlie, \"I'll see you before you know it.\"

 That's exactly what my old man used to say to me. And

 you know what it really meant? \"I have no idea when I'll

 see you.\" I wish there was something I could do. There's nothing

 anybody can do. It is what it is. Well, I think that's

 everything. We're really proud of you guys. Found your own apartment, did

 it all on your own. You really stepped up. When can we

 see the new place? Well, give us a few days, let us

 get it all fixed up. We should get going. Hold on, hold

 on, this is a big moment. Our boys have grown up. Let

 me just get one shot. Oh! I will treasure this memory always.

 I love you. Drive safe. Okay. Call us when you get there.

 PORTER: Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. I know this is good for

 them, but I have to tell you, I miss them already. (TOM

 LAUGHING) What the hell? Roy! Come on out! Our new tenants are

 here! (GASPS) (SIGHING) What are you doing? Deleting a memory. Yes, well,

 I really want to, I just don't see how I can with

 my dialysis schedule. Yes, dialysis. Really? Well, thank you so much. Jury

 duty, excused! That was over the phone. They didn't even get to

 see my sad head tilt with the trembling lower lip. Susan, using

 your disease to manipulate and deceive people. I've never felt closer to

 you. You know what? I deserve it. I mean, it's the only

 perk to come out of this whole thing. This stupid disease has

 totally changed my life. I spend six hours a day, three times

 a week hooked up to a machine. So, you know, if I

 get to cut in a few lines, get out of a ticket,

 I'm doing it. Ooh. Do you really want to use your powers

 for evil? I'm listening. Let's go to lunch at Girard's. I've been

 dying to try that place out, but they don't take reservations. And

 you have to wait hours for a table. Well, not with me,

 you don't. I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but

 bad-kidney Susan, way more fun than two-kidney Susan. You sure you want

 to eat here? I think I just saw two cockroaches throwing up.

 It's fine. Everyone in my family used to come here. Didrt they

 all die young of heart disease? Honey, you've seen this town. Would

 you really want to grow old here? Oh, my God, it's Gabrielle

 Marquez! Finally! We were wondering if you were ever gonna make it

 back home again. I am such a huge fan. I even have

 one of your swimsuit covers on my bathroom wall. It's my \"thinspiration.\"

 Could you have your chauffeur over here take a picture of us?

 - Would you mind? - Yeah. Be happy to, sir. Can I

 get your autograph? My autograph? You know, we even have a nacho

 platter named after you. It would be my honor to bring you

 one. Sounds great. Only make it a scoop of cottage cheese with

 sliced tomatoes. Ms. Marquez? Principal Gomez. I run the school you used

 to attend. Welcome back to Las Colinas. You have no idea how

 proud we are of you. Seriously? Yes, our young people don't have

 any role models. No one else from here has ever been famous.

 I mean, for anything besides getting stuck down a well. I can't

 believe all you people remembered me. I had no idea. You know,

 it would do so much for school morale if you would come

 by tomorrow and speak to the girls. Actually, we're kind of busy.

 I could call the press. But we're never too busy to help

 girls in need. How's noon? Gabby, our flight leaves at 10:00. Flights

 can be changed. I'm sorry. My chauffeur has no sense of community.

 (CHUCKLING) Now who else wants to take a picture with me? (DOOR

 OPENING) How did it go with Zach? Did you get him checked

 in? It's done. You must be so relieved. I know I am.

 After the riot, when you talked about us getting away, I felt

 so hopeful. But then it seemed like you, I don't know, pulled

 away? You've been so cold and distant. Not that I blame you.

 I can't imagine what you've been through. No, you can't. But now

 we can put it behind us. Get back to how we were.

 Start to build our life together. I miss you. I miss being

 close to you. What is that? (GASPS) Your gun. I borrowed it.

 Why did you feel you needed a gun? For protection. My son

 tried to kill me. Fool me once... What about you, Beth? What

 do you mean? I was just wondering why my bride needed to

 bring a gun into our home. You have to admit, it's not

 very romantic. If the gun bothers you, we can get rid of

 it. I don't understand. Are you upset with me? Is that why

 you've been acting this way? Paul, please talk to me. I have

 a lot on my mind. Of course you do. This whole thing

 has been a nightmare. But we've come through it. And with Zach

 getting help, maybe things will be good now. Really? When someone so

 close betrays you, can things ever be good again? I thought of

 something you could do for me. (LAUGHING) Again? But we just... No.

 No, not that. Remember yesterday when you said you wished there was

 something you could do about the whole Charlie situation? Mmm-hmm. Well, there

 is. Let's move to Florida. What? I've been thinking about this for

 hours. With my job I can work anywhere. You sold your business,

 your kids are grown. What's keeping you here? My friends. I will

 build a guest house. And they can stay all winter. Well, it

 would be an adventure. Totally. Come on. We'll pick oranges and swim

 with dolphins, and do all that other stuff you do in Florida.

 What do you say? I think I can't. Why? Because this is

 my home. I know. (SIGHING) There's just... There's no other way for

 me to be close to Charlie. Unless... Never mind. Unless what? Unless

 I move there without you. And I can't do that. Because long-distance

 relationships don't ever work, and I don't want to jeopardize what you

 and I have. Well, maybe we should talk about that. No, no,

 no, forget it. Forget the whole thing. All right, I... I just

 keep waiting for an answer to appear and there just isn't one.

 Let's go back to sleep. (SHUSHING) Local newspaper. So, since I've left

 Las Colinas, I've been everywhere. Paris, Rome, New York. But the place

 I feel most at home, probably New York. No, thank you. They're

 doing a cover story on me. \"Solis... So lovely.\" Isn't that great?

 It is, it's just that I think you're starting to lose track

 of why we came here. You still have some serious work to

 do. When are we going to that cemetery? I don't think I

 need to. Then how are you planning to get closure? It's already

 happening. This trip has been amazing. Look, you have to understand, when

 I lived in this town before, I felt like nothing. So to

 come back and get all this love from all these people, that's

 healing for me. I feel so much better. And I'm happy for

 you, Gabby. I just don't know if it's enough. It's enough for

 me, Carlos. (PHONE RINGING) Do you mind? That's the radio station. Hello?

 Yes, this is she. Absolutely, I'm all set. \"Hi. This is Gabrielle

 Marquez Solis, \"and when I'm in Las Colinas, I get my farm

 report from KYAP.\" This is not leaving the nest. This is more

 like nest-adjacent. I know. But Mrs. McCluskey is a tough old broad.

 If anyone can whip them into shape, she can. - (PHONE RINGING)

 - I'll get it. Hello? KAREN: How do you make a Denver

 omelet? Why do you want to know? 'Cause I made some for

 the boys and they didn't like them. They said yours are better.

 You know what? I'll be right over. And I'm like, \"You shut

 up.\" And he's like, \"No, you shut up!\" (ALL LAUGHING) So, tell

 me, who shut up? - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Mom. Hi, Prestors

 mom! Hi. So what brings you here? Your mom came by to

 share a few recipes with me. Good idea. We don't want a

 repeat of last night's pork fiasco. - (KIDS LAUGH) - (BUZZING) Dryer's

 done. I'll leave your clothes at the foot of your beds. -

 Whoa, whoa. - What? Please don't tell me you're doing their laundry.

 Oh, it's no bother. We love having the boys here. Don't we,

 Roy? RO Y: Yeah. Aside from them yelling out the answers to

 Wheel of Fortune, it's been a real treat. But seriously. That's gotta

 stop. The whole point of this was to get them to grow

 up and take care of themselves. They've just moved from my boob

 to yours. Nice breakfast talk, Lynette. They need to learn to be

 responsible. This isn't good for them. They're fine. Your sons are nice,

 upstanding young men. Sure, for one night. Give them time. Look, if

 they pull any shenanigans, I'll give them the boot. But so far,

 they've been the perfect tenants. Really? They had girls spend the night.

 You're okay with those two walking around your house? Look, I don't

 care what gets Roy's fire going as long as I'm the one

 who puts it out. Now, girls, if it were up to me

 I'd say avoid math and science, they cause serious frown lines. Gabby,

 please tell the nice girls you're joking. No. Young girls today need

 to know the dangers of long division. Excuse me, girls. Gabby, I

 have someone who I'm sure you want to say hello to. Hello,

 Gabrielle. You must remember Sister Marta. She's been with us almost 30

 years. A real treasure. Of course. I'll let you two catch up.

 So, Gabrielle, what brings you back? I have some personal business. Well,

 it looks like you're enjoying yourself. I'm not surprised. You always did

 love being the center of attention. You didn't seem too thrilled to

 see her. Who is she? Gabby? I'll be right back. We need

 to talk. All right. Do you remember a discussion we had here

 20 years ago? (LAUGHS) I've had a lot of students over the

 years, Gabrielle. I can't remember everything. I think you remember this conversation.

 I told you what was happening with my stepfather. Yes, you had

 a big imagination. Most likely from all of those trashy books and

 magazines you used to sneak into class. Oh, my God. You still

 don't believe me. I came to you with a secret. A horrible

 secret. I couldn't tell my mother or anyone in my family. But

 I thought I could trust you because you were my teacher. And

 a nun. So I told you. Do you remember what you said

 to me? I'm not going to stand here and listen to this.

 Yes, you are. You told me I was a liar, and that

 I should be ashamed of myself. And I have been ashamed ever

 since. Is that why you came back here? To blame me? No,

 I came back here because my therapist had a crazy idea. She

 thought it would help if I stood on the grave of the

 man who abused me and told him how I felt. But you

 know what? I think I need to tell you. I did not

 deserve what happened to me. I was a child. But you, you

 were a grown-up and you did nothing. You should be ashamed of

 yourself. Everything okay? Yes. We can go home now. (DOORBELL RINGING) Hi.

 I brought you a little housewarming present. Is it ticking? Look, I

 know I have been hard on you guys. But you landed on

 your feet, and this is just my way of saying, \"Have a

 blast.\" You deserve it. You're kidding! Wow. A whole keg? We can't

 drink that by ourselves. Well, maybe you should have a party. Yeah,

 it's a chance to show everyone your new digs. Everyone. I can

 wait all day. (SIGHING) Look, I already told you I'm not going

 to the police. I just want to know. Why did you shoot

 me? Because I wanted you to die. (SCOFFS) Too vague? Okay, I'm

 gonna try to be more specific. All my life I hated you.

 That is not true. It is true. That hate was always a

 part of me. But it started getting bigger. And then one day

 I realized it was the only thing that I was. That was

 the drugs making you think that way. I know that you want

 to believe that, but no, that was you, you did this to

 me. You do this to everyone. You're evil. You have no idea

 what I am, how I feel, what I've been through. When your

 mother, that horrible day... No, no, no. You don't get to use

 that to explain who you are. You are the reason Mom killed

 herself. Don't say that. It isn't true. Wow, that really hurt, didn't

 it? Maybe trying to kill you was stupid. 'Cause you being alive

 and knowing the truth, that's way better. Your mother loved me. No

 one could ever love you. PORTER AND PRESTON: Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm

 returning these. They're defective. I saw what happened to the front of

 your house. Boys, how could you? That's nothing. You should see the

 inside. They broke three of my collectible shot glasses. I was this

 close to having one from every state. You think I want to

 go back to Wyoming? What do you have to say to Mrs.

 McCluskey? Can we get our security deposit back? Monsters. So, what's for

 breakfast? Nothing. Fine. I'm going upstairs to crash. No! No! Once you

 are done cleaning up over at Mrs. McCluskey's, you guys are hitting

 the rental ads again. What? We just got evicted, and we're really

 hung over. This is not a good time. I don't believe you

 guys. You are fully grown men and you can't do anything for

 yourselves. You are just so helpless. Gee, I wonder how we got

 that way? What's that supposed to mean? Every time we try and

 do something, you say, \"It's easier if I do it myself.\" Yeah.

 We'd be happy to do stuff, but you always take over. It's

 like you don't want us to do anything for ourselves. You know

 what? You're right. We are? I guess I just wanted you to

 stay kids for as long as possible. Because I grew up with

 a crazy mom and two sisters to take care of. I was

 doing dishes and laundry when I should have been out riding bikes

 and throwing water balloons. I wanted you to have a childhood. But

 I let it go on too long. So I'm sorry. This is

 my fault. But it is time for you to go out and

 start your own lives. Okay. Okay. But before we go, can you

 make us an omelet? (LAUGHS) Yes. Actually, no. But I'll teach you

 to make one. Pretty impressive. You're thinking about Charlie, aren't you? Maybe

 I need something to get my mind off of him. How about

 a movie? You shouldn't have to get your mind off of him.

 He's your son. That's why you need to move to Florida. No.

 That was a bad idea. I already told you, I'm not going

 there without you. Long-distance relationships don't ever work. That's true. Unfortunately, you're

 in one right now with Charlie. Face it. One of these relationships

 isn't going to make it. And it has to be ours. Well,

 here's the only problem with that, I love you. I love you,

 too. Good. Then you know why I won't leave. Here's what I

 know. From the first day we met, I have been pretending that

 our age difference doesn't mean anything. Because it doesn't. It does. It

 means I have lived through more of life than you. Including having

 children. Which is something you desperately wanted, and now you have. Bree,

 come on. And while I have fallen in and out of love

 with several men in my life, I have never fallen out of

 love with my children. And you may think that you will never

 love another woman like you love me, but I know that you

 will. I don't see how that's possible. That's because you're young. You

 have given me so much, Keith. Please. Let me give this to

 you. Hi, there, we'd like a table, please. I'm sorry, you're looking

 at a two-hour wait. Susan. Do you think that you could squeeze

 us in? Because I have a dialysis appointment in an hour. Oh...

 It's just, we're so slammed... Just like my kidney. Let me see

 what I can do. MAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there. Why

 is she getting a table before us? We've been waiting 45 minutes.

 Sir, she's lost both of her kidneys. A booth would be great.

 Well, I'm a diabetic and my wife has rheumatoid arthritis, you don't

 see us trying to get any special treatment. You don't understand. I'm

 on dialysis. Arthritis, diabetes, dialysis. So, unless somebody here has Ebola, I

 think we should get the next table. You think there isn't anybody

 in this place who doesn't have something? We all have something. I

 have restless leg syndrome. Shut up. The only thing special about you

 is you think you're more special than the rest of us. You're

 not. Now get to the back of the line. You, too, sister.

 She used to be married to a Yankee. Nothing? Okay. I hope

 you know this means you're paying. I have to sit down. I

 don't feel well. (SIGHS) Nice try. We're not getting a table. Really,

 I don't feel well. Susan, get up. No one's even looking. Susan?

 Susan! Oh, my God! Someone call 911! Are you going away? No.

 You are. - Paul! - Come on! Stop! What are you doing?

 I want you out. Do you hear me? Why? What have I

 done? I know. What? I know who you are. Paul, please listen

 to me. At least Felicia had the guts to hate me to

 my face. You hid it. I don't hate you. I don't. -

 Get out, you lying bitch. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay,

 yes, I did lie. At first. And yes, I hated you because

 she told me to. Get out! But that changed. You changed me.

 I don't care what she says anymore. Please, Paul. Forgive me. Please.

 I love you. I swear to God, I love you. No, you

 don't. No one could ever love me. (GASPS) Don't forget your gun.

 MARY ALICE: Leaving is never easy. But the time comes when we

 must move on. So we can leave our childhood behind. So we

 can let go of the past. So we can be a good

 parent. Yes, leaving is never easy. Especially for those who have nowhere
