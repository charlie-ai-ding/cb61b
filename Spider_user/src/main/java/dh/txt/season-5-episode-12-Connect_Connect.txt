 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. A call was made. - Sweetie, where are you?

 - I don't want to tell you. But if Porter doesn't show

 up for court, we're going to lose our restaurant! A guy threatens

 to kill your son, and that's what you're worried about? And as

 one love affair blossomed, another... You were married before? She's dead. I

 want you out of my house. Withered on the vine. Mike Delfino

 has to pay for taking you away from me. I want him

 to lose what I lost. It had been a long journey for

 David Williams. And though it began years ago, he remembered every step

 of it. Walking outside his front door to find a policeman with

 news of a car crash. Running into the hospital only to be

 told his wife and daughter had died. No! No! Being dragged into

 a psychiatric facility after his mental breakdown. No! Strolling into a hotel,

 weeks after being released, and bumping into a beautiful blonde. Marching down

 the aisle with the woman who, as it turned out, once lived

 on the same street with the man who had killed his family.

 But his bride was now unhappy. And Dave Williams was worried that

 his dream of revenge had been destroyed. Luckily for Dave, fate was

 about to take some steps of its own. - Hey, Dave! What's

 going on? - Edie and I had a fight. Take it you're

 giving her time to calm down? No, I think I'm looking for

 a place to stay while she's looking for a lawyer. Oh, man.

 I want to say something helpful, but all I got is, \"That

 sucks.\" That it does. So where are you headed? Well, it's such

 a nice night, I thought I'd walk to that motel on the

 interstate. Might as well enjoy the stars while my life falls apart.

 It's getting late. So... Hey, why don't you stay with me? Really?

 I... I wouldn't want to impose. Dave, you saved my life. I

 owe you. Well, now that you mention it, I guess you do.

 Come on in. And just like that, Dave's dream of revenge was

 salvaged. Lead the way, roomie. And he started to feel his long

 journey would soon be over. At 9:02 the next morning, Edie Williams

 began calling her friends to let them know something humiliating had happened

 to her. By 9:06, her friends had begun to arrive just so

 they could hear the juicy details. So he was married before. You

 don't kick a man out for that. No, but you do for

 never mentioning it. And especially when I laid out my entire past.

 Emphasis on the word \"laid.\" Exactly. Gabby gets it. Well, maybe they

 were only together a short time, and she didn't mean anything to

 him. I doubt it, since he walks around muttering to her ghost.

 You know what would lift your spirits? We should all do a

 spa weekend. - Yeah. - Let's do that. Oh. I appreciate the

 offer, but I think I'm better off getting lost in my work.

 Well, maybe I can help you. Think you can rent my house

 out? What? Jackson got a teaching job at the college in Riverton,

 and I'm going with him. Wait. You're moving? I know it's sudden,

 but I feel really good about this, and it's only two hours

 away, so it'll still be like we're practically next door. I am

 so happy for you. But we're going to miss you. Oh. Don't

 worry about us. Jackson is so great. You are making the right

 choice. Absolutely. Come here, you. I can't believe you're leaving. Hey. When

 you're done here, you want to come do my lawn? Well, I

 figured since Mike's letting me crash here, it's the least I could

 do. Well, that's very nice and brave. Mike takes a lot of

 pride in his yard. - Yeah. - Look at his roses. Every

 time I walk by here I just want to steal one. -

 Here, let me cut you one. - Oh, no. Couldn't. He wouldn't

 like that. - Hey, you. What's up? - Not much. Got a

 call from Dylan. Her husband's traveling more for his business and she

 doesn't have anybody to help her with the baby. She's trying to

 push me to move out to Baltimore. So, what'd you say? Just

 that I'd think about it. What do you think I should do?

 Well, if she really needs your help, I guess you should help

 her. Well, I don't know that she needs it. Honestly, I think

 she's just lonely. Of course, it would be nice to be closer.

 But is that a good enough reason to uproot my whole life

 here? What do you think? I'm not sure. It's up to you.

 I know, I just thought you might have an opinion. Oh, shoot.

 I'm expecting a call from a supplier. I'll... I'll talk to you

 later. On second thought, I'm sure he won't even notice it's gone.

 Of course, this new landscaping will require an updated irrigation system, which

 I'm happy to take care of. Bree, you bought us a house.

 We can't let you do all this, too. Nonsense. It's a small

 price to pay to make your home more beautiful. - I insist.

 - Yes! It's going to be here tomorrow! - Orson, take it

 easy. - Impossible. Soon I, the grill master, will christen a brand

 new barbecue. You seem pretty excited about a grill. Oh. It's so

 much more than that, young man. This is the Prairie Fire Turbo.

 It's 122,000 BTUs of charbroiling power. Look out, cattle. You think you're

 excited, just imagine the salesman who overcharged you. Well, Bree, I got

 a very good deal. He only thinks he got a good deal

 because the salesman threw in one of those \"Kiss the Cook\" hats.

 And the temperature-sensing barbecue fork. - Well, that sounds good. - Yeah.

 Don't encourage him. Orson is a horrible negotiator. He's never met a

 sticker price he didn't like. - No, Bree, that's... - It's true.

 There's a reason the local car dealers send you a fruit basket

 every Christmas. Now, hush. - Bree, could you please not do that?

 - Do... Do what? It's just, when you talk to your husband

 that way, it really pushes a button for me. My mom used

 to do that and it drove my dad away. I think he

 was tired of being emasculated. Did I mention it has a rear-mounted

 rotisserie rack? What exactly are you saying, Alex? I'm saying, if you're

 going to be rude to your husband, could you just not do

 it in front of me? - So, a rotisserie, huh? - Yeah.

 Good for chicken, rolled roasts, legs of lamb. This thing is so

 advanced, I could probably use it to make soup. I'm sorry. Daddy

 has to work. Carlos, what is going on? You're going to miss

 your plane. They're upset. They're not used to me being away. Oh,

 for God's sake, girls. It's not like he's going off to war.

 He's going to be back tomorrow. Why can't Daddy work here? Because

 Daddy has a new job that's going to make us lots of

 money. We don't need lots of money. Hey, what did I say

 about that kind of language? Look. Girls, Daddy is going to be

 home tomorrow in time for dinner. You can call me whenever you

 want. Okay? - Okay. - Yeah. And the best part is, you

 get to spend a whole day with just Mommy. - Oh. Hello,

 Mr. Fishman. - I'm coming in. Watch the wheels. Boy, you just

 had to put a rug here, huh? - Uh, is everything okay?

 - It's about your damn son. - Porter? - How the hell

 do I know? He's got red hair and he's got a face

 you just want to slap. And he's driving my sister crazy. -

 What are you talking about? - At the retirement home. Your kid

 has been staying in your mom's room. What? Muriel thought he was

 just visiting, but he's been there for a week. Oh! Now, the

 rules clearly state, no visiting after dark. Tom, I know where Porter

 is. He's hiding at my mother's. Oh. Hiding, my ass. He's not

 hiding. He's living there. - He even stole my sister's orange juice.

 - I'll take care of it. Thank you. Call Bob. Tell him

 we can make the hearing tomorrow. Nobody can sleep there because he's

 got that TV blaring all night long. Look, Tom. I can't talk

 now. Just call Bob. I'm going over there now. Okay, bye. Parker,

 I'm gonna be back in an hour. Mr. Fishman, thank you so

 much. Well, don't just stand there. Make me a sandwich. Uh. One

 more thing. Could you see about having the basement cleared out? Yeah,

 the last time we went down there it was filled with mildewed

 boxes. Oh, I'll take care of that. There's nothing worse than having

 old junk around. Edie! Case in point. Edie? Edie! Do you not

 hear me? Yeah, I heard you. Why do you think I kept

 walking? Looks like the mailman switched our mail again. Do you have

 mine? Yeah, it's in my garbage. Come by and grab it at

 your convenience. What is wrong with you? I asked everyone over this

 morning because I had this huge thing to share about kicking my

 husband out. And you prance in with your, \"Me and Jackson are

 moving to a fairy castle!\" I'm sorry, I thought we gave your

 latest breakup the three seconds of shock it deserved. - Get the

 hell out of here. - Gladly. - What have you done? -

 Nothing. It's locked. - Do you have a key? - In my

 purse, which I left in the kitchen. Does anyone know you're here?

 No. - Help! - Somebody help me! Let me out of here!

 Juanita, it's time for your bath. I'm watching my movie. You've seen

 it a hundred times. She loses her shoe, the prince finds it,

 end of story. Let's go. I'll go when I'm ready. - Hey!

 It's not finished! - It is for you. Now move. Juanita Solis,

 I am not kidding. Okay, that does it. Juanita. If you think

 I'm not going to drag you to the bathroom, you are sadly

 mistaken. - You're never going to make it. - Oh, yes, I

 will. My rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine. What's

 wrong? My rage just needs to catch its breath. Okay. Okay. I

 am willing to forget this entire incident if you just go jump

 in that bath tub right now. What do you say? I am

 going to scrub that smug look right off your face. Oh, my

 back! Where is he? I'm sorry, have we met? Wait. You're the

 girl who stuck me here three years ago. You come by every

 Christmas and look at your watch while I unwrap the socks you

 bought me on the drive over. Do you know what's going on

 with Porter? The fire? The arrest? Yes, I read the newspapers. Everybody's

 crying for that poor kid's blood. No, no, we have this great

 lawyer. He thinks he can get the case thrown out. Oh, really?

 I didn't realize that. Porter, come out from under the bed! Mommy

 is here to take care of you. Just like she took care

 of me. Okay, I know you're mad. I know we have a

 lot to hash out between us. But don't take your hate for

 me out on your grandson. - Now where is he? - He's

 safe. I heard Muriel Fishman rat me out to her brother, so

 I made sure that Porter cleared out. Mom, this is wrong. Please.

 Sucks to feel powerless, doesn't it, Lynette? Please! Help! Please! Wow, I'm

 getting a really unpleasant picture of what you're like in the old

 sackarooni. Face it, Mayer. We're stuck. I've got to get out. I'm

 supposed to be meeting the moving company. What? Keep talking about how

 you're going to move away and be with Jackson. I hear stupidity

 makes time go faster. So now, me wanting to be with the

 man I love is stupid? And needy. And pathetic. And kind of

 hilarious. But there's one thing it's not, Mayer, that's unexpected. What are

 you getting at? Have you ever in your life been without a

 man? Of course I have. - When? - I don't know. I'm

 not sure. - What are you doing? - Making a calendar. Edie.

 Oh. Come on. We've got nothing but time, and I assume you

 don't want to make out, so... First boyfriend? Todd Shaffer. I was

 14. And why did you and Hot Toddy break up? He dumped

 me during math class. And how long did it take you to

 start dating somebody else? This is a stupid exercise. I refuse to...

 - When was it? - Lunch. It was lunch. You know, I'm

 feeling a bit randy tonight. What do you say we make a

 little love? Well, we've got 15 minutes until the news is on.

 Why not? I still can't get over the way Alex behaved this

 morning. \"Emasculating.\" I've never heard such nonsense. Don't you think so? Well,

 I thought the manner in which Alex - made his point was

 inappropriate. - But? Well, I wouldn't say it was nonsense. You can

 be a little tough sometimes. Tough? That's not a word I would

 use to describe myself. Nobody blames you, Bree. You run a business.

 You have to be formidable. Sometimes, if that frame of mind carries

 over into your personal life, - it's only to be expected. -

 I don't think I do that. I know you don't. But it's

 not worth getting upset about. Andrew and I are used to it.

 And I'm sure, in time, Alex will get used to it, too.

 Now, on to more pleasant things. Even though it's my turn, I

 don't mind if you're on top. I think we forgot one. Ah!

 Didn't you date somebody after you stole Karl away from me? Ron...

 Dr. Ron. - Are we done? - Yep. Here it is. The

 history of your love life. Proof that you can't be happy without

 a man. This is not proof of anything. Seven boyfriends through high

 school and college. Only 41 days single. What does that tell you?

 - My grades sucked? - It's a cry for help, Mayer. And

 it doesn't get much better into the many decades of your adulthood.

 Hey, I was single for several months after Karl. And after Mike.

 But that wasn't of your choosing. They dumped you. I know. It's

 hard to look in the mirror. Have you ever looked in your

 mirror, Edie? You're famous for the number of men you've conquered. -

 Thank you. - That's not a compliment, you tramp! Okay, I am

 not going to take relationship tips from a woman who has hooked

 up with, what is it, over a thousand men? Okay, that's true.

 I enjoyed the '80s. But the difference is I go after men

 because I want them. You go after them because you need them.

 - That is not much of a distinction. - Yes, it is.

 You have holes in your heart that can only be filled by

 a pair of trousers. Face it, Mayer. You're weak. Porter wasn't there.

 And she won't tell me where he is. Did you tell her

 that he could end up in jail? Of course I did. Lynette,

 you're really upset. Just hang up and come home. She's so angry

 at me. She's never going to tell us where he is. Lynette?

 Lynette! - We need to find Lynette Scavo. - Let me check.

 This is all my fault. She was so worked up when she

 left my room. I'm not finding a Lynette Scavo. Oh, my God.

 Does that mean she's dead? No. No. It means she outsmarted her

 mom. My God, Porter! We missed you so much. I don't understand.

 I thought you were in an accident. No, sweetie. I was driving

 home last night, talking with your dad on the phone, and two

 cars in front of me had an accident. And I thought, \"Damn,

 that could be me.\" And then I thought, \"That could be me.\"

 You scared the hell out of me. We are sorry, but we

 had to get you back. You've got to be in court by

 5:00. - No. I don't want to go to jail. - Porter,

 listen to me. Bob talked to the judge. He thinks he can

 get them to drop the charges. I don't know if I should

 believe you. You're going to have to. - Okay. - Great. Come

 on. Let's go. That was a rotten thing you did, Lynette. I

 thought you were dead. Yeah, well, what can I tell you? I

 learned from the best. Celia! Juanita! I am not going to ask

 you again to pick up these clothes. You've got until the count

 of three. One. Two. Three. You can hear me, right? - Yeah.

 - Yeah. All right, that's it. I'm calling your father. Ooh, you

 are going to get it now. He is going to tear into

 you... It is going to be a bloodbath. Hey, babe. What's up?

 - It's your children. They've run amok. - What? Now that you've

 gone back to work, they won't listen to me. They know you're

 not in the next room ready to drop the hammer. Help me!

 How? I'm in a meeting. Oh. Okay. I'm going to put you

 on speaker, and I want you to rip them a new one.

 I'm with clients. I don't have time for this. - But... -

 I've got to go. Carlos! Carlos? I think he hung up, Mommy.

 Can you bring us a lemonade? - Hi, Mike. - Hey. Sorry

 I'm late. - Where's Katherine? - Headache. She sends her regrets. Oh.

 - You mind if I grab a beer? - Yeah. In the

 test kitchen. Beer sounds good. I think I'll grab one, too. Excuse

 me. - So, Katherine not feeling well, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I

 think she also might be a little miffed with me. This about

 Baltimore? It's not that I want her to go. Because I don't.

 Well, why don't you tell her? I don't want to be the

 guy that comes between her and her daughter. Not to mention, her

 grandchild. Oh. I thought this was because, I don't know, maybe you're

 still hung up on your ex-wife. Susan? No. No, that's over. You

 sure? Most guys I talk to, they say they only really fall

 in love once. And even if it doesn't work, they spend the

 rest of their lives thinking about the one that they lost. Always

 wondered if that's how you felt about Susan. Why would you wonder

 about something like that? I don't know. You... You're my friend. I

 care about you. Well, no. In fact, I think I might be

 falling in love with Katherine. Did you just use the \"L\" word?

 Wow! See, I didn't realize it was that serious. Well, to be

 honest, it didn't really hit me until she said she might leave.

 Where are our guests? The food's going to get cold. - I'll

 go find them. - And bring some steak sauce. Oh. You're not

 going to need any sauce with these babies. They are seasoned to

 perfection. Bring it. Well, there's no sense in waiting. Dig in. Oh,

 dear. Are they overcooked? No. They're well done. That's the way I

 like them. - Bree? What do you think? - I really couldn't

 say. You couldn't say if your meat is overcooked? No. I wouldn't

 want to upset anyone. Well, don't worry. You won't upset me. I

 don't think she was referring to you. Well, it's just that grilling

 is such a manly pastime. If I suggested that Orson somehow failed

 to produce the perfect steak, you might see it as another example

 of emasculation. I see. You're not going to let that go, are

 you? Well, for all I know, telling Orson his steak tastes like

 charcoal might be de-balling him. You know, Bree, you can make your

 point and still be nice. You know what else would be nice,

 Alex? Showing gratitude when people have been generous with you. Don't listen

 to her, Alex. She's not mad at you. She's mad at me

 and the meat. Gratitude? What do you mean by that? I mean,

 I bought you a house. You'd think you'd show me a little

 respect. Seriously? You're bringing up the house? Well, why not? It was

 a fairly grand gesture on my part. Yes, and one that apparently

 comes with strings. If by strings, you mean I won't let you

 be rude to me in my own house, then yes. You know

 what, I think I'm going to have to decline your grand gesture.

 Keep the house. What's wrong? Orson burnt the steaks. Susan, how can

 you tell if pickles have botulism? What the hell, I shoot the

 stuff into my forehead. Forget it. I'd rather starve for a day

 or two. By then you'll be dead and I can use your

 remains as a source of protein. Oh. Come on. That was funny.

 You know, maybe I do feel incomplete without a man. But I

 wouldn't trade places with you for anything. You want to know why?

 No. But I'm trapped, so knock yourself out. It's the way you

 are with men. They're like tissues. You use one and toss it

 away, and then you're on to the next one. At least I'm

 looking for something real. So, you think this \"happy ending\" crap that

 you believe in is real? Please, I know what men are really

 like. Really? Well, when I was 16, my dad had an affair

 with this woman who had a 10-year-old daughter. And one day he

 told my mom and me that he was leaving us for them.

 Oh, my God. No talking. A week later, he comes to the

 house to get his stuff. And my mom didn't want to see

 him, so we went to the movies. Now, I had this horse

 figurine collection, plastic, glass, ceramics, hundreds of them. Anyway, we come back

 from the movies and my dad had taken all his stuff. So,

 I go into my bedroom and something seems different. And then I

 realize all of my horses are gone. My mom called my dad

 and screamed. And all he said was I was too old for

 them, and that his girlfriend's daughter would appreciate them more. Can you

 believe that? What a fungus. Oh, God, are you crying? It's just...

 Now I get it. Get what? All these years I have judged

 you, and it is not your fault. Come here. You are the

 way you are because of your father. Ow! Edie! What the hell?

 Don't psychoanalyze me, you simp! I was just trying to tell you

 how selfish men are! And I was just trying to be nice,

 and give you a free pass for being such a big slut!

 Ahhh! Edie! Okay, girls, pick up your toys and put them in

 the basket before dinner. Dinner's not for two hours. Hey! I've had

 enough of your crap. Now pick up these toys. No! Okay, Juanita,

 what is going on here? Why are you being so difficult? When

 Daddy asks you to do something, you just do it. That's because

 I love Daddy more. Fine. - Everything okay, Mrs. Solis? - Yeah.

 Just my kids. They really know how to push my buttons. Oh,

 yeah, I've got a couple monsters at home, too. The key is

 you've got to be the bigger monster. Well, unfortunately, they're not afraid

 of me. Oh. That's bad. Fear is the foundation of all good

 parenting. You've got to practice your big voice. \"Finish that broccoli now!\"

 - See how that works? - Yeah, it's very effective. Well... Hey,

 you got an extra 15 minutes? Do it! Faster! Faster! Faster! I

 want to see this place sparkle! Mommy... It's out of my hands,

 girls. Word got out that you were disobeying, and they sent Reggie

 over. Who sent Reggie over? Well, I know how much you love

 him, but it was your daddy. Enough chatter! Keep moving! When they're

 done, you want me to make them vacuum? - Lf you wouldn't

 mind. - No. - Guess. - Come on, Edie. I said I

 was sorry. Guess. July? Wrong! March! Man, you're bad at this. Guess.

 Hey, Mrs. Williams. I didn't know you were down here. Thank God!

 We've been locked in here all night. Really? Good thing I came

 by to check the rat traps then. I'm glad I forgot about

 those until now. Uh. Mayer. I would appreciate it if you wouldn't

 talk about what we talked about. - I wasn't planning to. -

 Good. Because I'll deny it if you do. - I won't. -

 And I'll kill you. Goodbye, Edie. Oh. I'll bring your mail over

 when I get home. Thanks. Hey, Mom. I just came by to

 tell you that the judge threw out Porter's case for lack of

 evidence. Isn't that great? Mom, I did not put you in here

 to punish you. I didn't have a choice. - You had a

 choice. - No, I didn't. From the moment Glen died, you were

 out of control. It's true. You lost all that money in Vegas.

 You started drinking again. And how many times did I go to

 your condo only to find you asleep on the sofa with a

 cigarette in your mouth? No. I won't apologize for bringing you here.

 I did it because I love you. Then why don't you come

 visit me? It's not a very pleasant experience. So I yell a

 little. So I toss a few curse words your way. Big deal.

 Last time I came, you threw pudding at me. I'm an angry

 old woman, Lynette. What do you expect? Here's a thought, stop being

 angry. How? I can't make a friend in this place without having

 them drop dead of a stroke five minutes later. I feel like

 hell. Every time I look in the mirror, I want to scream.

 My anger is all I've got left, baby. If I let go

 of that, it's over. I know it. The ball game will be

 over. The ball game is going to end whether you like it

 or not. I would like to be here with you for whatever

 time you have left. But for that to happen, things have to

 change. Would you come visit me more often? At least twice a

 week. And sometimes I'd bring the kids. I'd like that. You know,

 they turned out really good. How did you learn how to be

 such a good mom? I have no idea. Well, now that you're

 here, why don't you stay and we can talk a while? -

 Okay. - Get my flask out of the drawer. Hey, I can't

 be nice, forgiving and sober all at the same time. Hey. -

 Daddy! - Daddy! Missed you guys. Wow, you're really helping Mommy, huh?

 That's great. The scary man told us we had to. We don't

 even know the guy! He left a flier in our mailbox. You

 let him do your parenting? Hey, you're the one who told me

 to get creative. This wasn't what I meant! Easy for you to

 say. They told me they love you more than me. And when

 I was running things, they said they loved you more. Really? -

 Oh. - So don't get your feelings hurt. And stop asking strangers

 to discipline our kids. Well, I wouldn't have to if you would

 do it. So you want me to go to work all day,

 go out on business trips, and what little time I have here

 with the girls, you want me to spend screaming at them? Just

 for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door. -

 Then it's Carlos time. - Forget it. This was the arrangement you

 wanted. You made me take this job. I just wanted us to

 have a normal life. Well, guess what, sweetie? Dad's unhappy at work,

 Mom's home with the screaming kids. You've got one. Oh, good. You're

 back. Can we talk? If it's about work, yes. If it's about

 what happened at the barbecue, no. Fine. Then as my employee, I

 authorize a five-minute break so we can talk about my son's boyfriend

 and his absurd overreaction this afternoon. That's it. I'm out of here.

 Andrew, please. You were there. Alex started the whole thing. You need

 to tell him to stop criticizing me. I'm not getting in the

 middle of this. If you have a problem with Alex, you tell

 him. I tried. He won't listen to me. Don't you mean \"obey\"?

 He's not your son, he's not your husband, he's not your employee...

 Not everyone has to listen to you. I'll do this tomorrow. I

 got the flowers. - They were from you, right? - Oh, yeah.

 I just have a minute. And I don't want to get into

 a whole thing with you. This won't take long. I don't want

 to fight anymore. Please, just take the house. I don't know how

 else to say this. What happened yesterday is going to happen again.

 It's not going to be the last time we fight, because that's

 who we are. Let's not make it worse by living on top

 of each other. Alex, I'm going to tell you something I haven't

 told anybody. Not Orson, not Andrew, just you. I know that I've

 changed since my business took off, but I didn't want to admit

 it. I've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude. I was never the

 type to suffer fools gladly, but now I seem to find fools

 everywhere. And I don't want to be that way. I need someone

 who isn't afraid to speak out, to call me out when I

 cross those lines. And I would love it if you would be

 that person. Did my mother-in-law just give me permission to criticize her?

 Yes, I did. I'm a lucky guy. Edie. Listen, I'm not happy

 about you lying to me. But I think what we have is

 real, and, well, I'm not ready to throw it away. Really? Don't

 tell anyone, but I'm at the point in my life where I

 could use a happy ending. I'll get my stuff. Hello? - Jackson,

 hi. Do you have a sec? - Sure, is something wrong? No,

 nothing's wrong. I just... We need to talk about this move. At

 5: 15 that afternoon, Edie Williams began calling her friends to inform

 them that her husband had come home. Sadly, she never got through

 to any of them. Gabrielle never picked up. She was too busy

 watching her children being told they had to obey their mother. And

 trying not to smile. Lynette wasn't home when Edie called. She was

 with her mother, laughing and sharing stories about the old days, and

 enjoying every minute of it. Bree was outside showing her future son-in-law

 color samples for the home she had bought him, and smiling politely

 when they disagreed. And Susan, well, she didn't answer because she was

 sitting in her favorite chair with a cup of tea, learning to

 enjoy, for the first time in her life, what it was like
