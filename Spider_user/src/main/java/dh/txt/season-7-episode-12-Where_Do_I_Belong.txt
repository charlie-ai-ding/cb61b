 on Desperate Housewives. The riot left victims in its wake. Do I

 need a transplant? You need to come to terms with the reality

 of what's happened to you. We'd like to know where exactly you

 were when your husband was shot. My wife is the one person

 on that backstabbing street that I can trust. So what am I

 supposed to do? Just pretend Grace doesn't exist? Yes. Gabby's biological daughter

 was erased, and she struggled to cope. I slept with Tom. And

 Lynette learned the truth. Tom Scavo had a 20-year-old secret. He had

 once slept with his wife's best friend. Tom felt it no longer

 mattered. But his wife, who had just learned this secret, felt differently.

 That's why she had decided to punish him, and torture him, and

 humiliate him. Lynette planned to tell her husband she knew, but first,

 she was determined to have her revenge. What are my keys doing

 on the floor? Did my pants just rip? Yeah. You might want

 to go up and change. Wow. Thank God I wasn't going commando.

 I'm sorry you had to see that. Is that a seam ripper?

 Could be. I don't really sew. Did you do something to Tom's

 pants? Lynette. It's just a thing I do whenever I find out

 he slept with one of my friends. I knew I shouldn't have

 told you about us. But you did! So, this is how you're

 getting back at him? Isn't it a little immature? My rage needs

 an outlet. You gotta admit, it beats smashing his head in with

 a nine-iron. Well, there is another option. You could tell him you

 know and deal with it. -No! -Well, why not? Because then he'll

 tell me he's sorry, and I'll cry and he'll cry, and then

 I'll get over it. And I'm not ready to get over it.

 I have a lot of anger to work through before we sweep

 this under the carpet and move on. So please don't tell him

 what I'm doing. -But, Lynette, it... -Come on. It's not like anybody's

 getting hurt. Tom! Are you okay? Yeah. I slipped on something. Peanut

 butter? Those damn kids. Yes, Lynette Scavo had developed a taste for

 revenge. And she was finding it delicious. We pass by these people

 every day. We sense their isolation, but we just keep walking, telling

 ourselves there's nothing we can do to help, which we know is

 a lie. Hello, Reverend. Wonderful sermon today. Thank you, Bree. Do you

 have a moment? I need to talk to you about something. Sure.

 One of our parishioners is going through a personal crisis. She's in

 desperate need of a friend, someone to talk to. And you thought

 of me? I'm flattered. So you wouldn't mind reaching out to this

 lost lamb? You are the very milk of human kindness. Now, stop.

 I'm happy to help. Unless you're talking about Beth Young, in which

 case I'd rather shave my head and join the Hare Krishnas. Bree!

 I'm sorry, but she is married to the biggest lunatic in Fairview.

 He tried to destroy our neighborhood, and she did nothing to stop

 him. Still, the Christian thing is to offer her solace. After all,

 \"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.\" John, chapter

 eight, verse seven. What about, \"The righteous will be glad when they

 are avenged, \"when they bathe their feet in the blood of the

 wicked\"? Psalm 56, verse 10. \"If you do not forgive others their

 sins, \"your Father will not forgive yours.\" Matthew, chapter six, verse 15.

 \"Whoever does not obey the laws of God \"must surely be punished

 by death or banishment.\" Ezra, chapter seven, verse 26. \"Bree Van De

 Kamp is shacking up with her boyfriend.\" Cynthia Thomas, pew five, seat

 seven. Fine. I'll talk to her, but this is spiritual blackmail. I'm

 a man of God, Bree. I do what it takes to get

 the job done. Everything's delicious, Gabby. Thank you. I'm glad you guys

 could come. Well, you know us. We never turn down a champagne

 brunch. Who said anything about champagne? I did. Come on, people, we

 need some bubbly! We gotta celebrate! Celebrate what? -Do you... -Okay, it's

 kind of a long story. It all started last year... We're adopting

 a child. You were killing the moment. Meet Liza Hunter-McDermott. Liza? Guess

 who lost that coin toss. She's beautiful. There was a two-year wait

 for a baby, but we found this orphanage that had lots of

 older kids, so we figured why not? She's 10 years old, and

 if all goes well, she's ours next month. Well, we're really happy

 for you guys. Aren't we, Gabby? Gabby, what's wrong? Nothing. I'm thrilled

 for you. Really. Oh, honey. We didn't even think. With everything you've

 been going through... She's fine. It's just, I don't even know where

 Grace is, or how she is, or when I'm gonna see her

 again. Gabby! We didn't mean to upset you guys. It's fine. She's

 gone, and now Gabby and I are moving on. And we've agreed

 not to talk about it because it is so painful. I'm sure

 you understand. Of course. So please, tell us more about your little

 girl. What is she like? You're gonna love her. I mean, she's

 so smart and so funny. The first time we walked in that

 room there was this instant connection. We just knew she was ours.

 You know what? We should make a toast to little Liza. I'm

 gonna get that champagne. Look who I found. Julie! What are you

 doing here? I told you not to fly home. Mom, haven't you

 learned I don't listen to a word you say? Besides, they won't

 let you mail a major organ. Oh, no. No, don't even think

 about it. You are not gonna be my donor. I did tons

 of research. They have these new surgical techniques. It's no worse than

 a belly piercing. Which I did not do. You know, the doctor

 did say that blood relatives are your best chance for a match.

 Honey, you are not going through the rest of your life with

 only one kidney. -But, Mom... -No. I'm going on the wait list.

 That could take years. You know, there is another option. Somebody who

 is close to you, that loves you very much. We've been through

 this. You're not the right blood type. I meant your mother. My

 mother? Mike, I already lost my kidney, now you want me to

 lose my mind? No, no, no, no. We are not asking her

 for a kidney. No. In fact, we're not even telling her about

 this. We're not? Of course not. If she heard one word about

 this... Oh, my God. Julie, what did you do? I'm sorry. You're

 hurt, I thought you'd want her to know, and she'll be here

 tomorrow. Oh, my God! I've gotta get out of here. Unhook me,

 unhook me. No, no, no, no. Susan, this is good. You need

 a kidney, she's got a kidney. That I will be paying for

 the rest of my life! \"How come you haven't visited? I gave

 you my kidney.\" \"Why won't you friend me on Facebook? \"I gave

 you my kidney.\" No, this is a nightmare. You owe me, Julie.

 Big. You're right. How about I give you a kidney? Bigger than

 that. Don't react. Good not reacting! What the hell are you doing

 back there? I can't let her see me talking to you. Who?

 Lynette. She knows. Knows what? About us? How? Who cares how? The

 point is she found out. Why hasn't she said anything to me?

 She's saying it. Your pants splitting open, falling down the stairs. Haven't

 you noticed you've been a little accident-prone lately? -That was her? -Mmm.

 So she's responsible for my flat tire? Mmm-hmm. The sardines in my

 gym bag? Yep. The gay porn in my PowerPoint presentation? Her proudest

 moment. So she's just gonna keep on screwing with me? I mean,

 what else's she got planned? I don't know, but she is one

 angry woman. Be careful. God knows what she'll do next. Ow! What

 the hell are you doing? Testing the brakes before I get on

 the highway. Hi! I haven't seen you out in a while, so

 I thought I'd stop by and see how you're doing. What do

 you really want? Well, I talked to Reverend Sikes yesterday, and he

 tells me that you've been going through kind of a rough patch.

 Come on in. You know, growing up, I didn't really have a

 lot of friends. We weren't a very social family. But I was

 never hated. Nobody hates you. But they hate my husband, don't they?

 I just wish people could understand him. He is not a bad

 man. It's just his life has been so difficult. He went to

 prison for a murder he didn't commit. His wife killed herself. His

 son hates him. He's been through a lot. Well, I may not

 be able to convince people to like Paul, but there's no reason

 you should suffer for what he's done. I am having the girls

 over this week, and I think it would be wonderful if you'd

 join us. Oh. That's very sweet, but I think we both know

 those women aren't gonna want me there. Those women are my dear

 friends. Trust me, they'll be fine with it. And if they're not?

 Well, then I'll just have to twist some very dear arms. Okay,

 Mrs. Delfino, you're all hooked up. Where's my daughter? They said she

 was down here. -Do you see her? -Oh, God. Are you in

 pain? No, but I will be. Oh! Susan! Mom! My poor, sick

 baby! Hello, Mike. Honey, I have a surprise for you. One of

 your favorite things from home! Get in here! Aunt Claire. She figured

 I was cheaper than flowers. Mike, you haven't met my aunt. She

 taught me how to make a Manhattan when I was eight. I

 had her up to Old Fashioneds by the time she was 12.

 And that's a difficult drink. She's like the bartender I never had.

 So, sweetheart, your mother tells me you have a deformed kidney? I

 told her not to sleep on her side. Well, we're hoping to

 find a donor very soon. Oh! Wouldn't that be nice? I wonder

 who it'll be. You read all these stories. Strangers brought together through

 life-threatening circumstances. Our best bet is a match within the family. Oh.

 Like Julie? No. MJ? He's nine, Mom. You don't take a kidney

 out of a 9-year-old. It'd take care of that bed-wetting problem, though,

 wouldn't it? No, we were actually thinking that you might be a

 possible donor, Sophie. Oh. Oh. Oh? What do you mean \"oh\"? Well,

 it's just... It's... I can't believe this. She's not gonna do it.

 Of course she wants to. It's just the timing of things. Morty

 and I are about to take a cruise for three months. A

 cruise? Non-refundable. And you won't even get tested? You know, we haven't

 even checked in at the hotel yet. Why don't we do that?

 Yes, okay. We'll be back in an hour or two. And if

 you're better, if you feel like it, maybe we'll take you shopping.

 Actually, I'm having my blood washed for the next six hours. But

 go, you two have fun. Hey, there. Oh! Perfect timing. double fudge

 brownies. Well, I had a big lunch, and I don't want any

 more pants ripping. So, no thanks. What are you talking about? You

 look great. Have one. It won't kill you. Yeah, maybe later. Are

 you sure? They're tasty. Brownies. Can I have one? No! Yeah. Sure,

 Penny, have one. No! I mean, I don't want her to spoil

 her dinner. Besides, I made these for your dad. Oh, I can

 share. Here, Penny, take it. Eat it. No! You guys are weird.

 What did you put in there? Cayenne pepper? Drain cleaner? So Renee

 told you. I'm gonna kill her. Let's get back to how you're

 trying to kill me. Don't you dare act like the injured party

 here! You betrayed me. You had an affair. It wasn't an affair.

 It was completely meaningless. It was after we were engaged. No, we

 had broken up, remember? No, no. We were taking a break, remember?

 Yes, we were fighting constantly, so we decided to spend some time

 apart to decide whether we were gonna get married or split up.

 Right. So I went to my mom's house to think about it.

 And I will never forget this. I was sitting in the kitchen,

 my mom was making a frittata, and I thought, \"Oh! I should

 make that for Tom.\" And then it hit me, there might be

 no Tom. I might never see you again. And I had an

 epiphany. I didn't want a life without you in it. Yeah, I

 was at a crossroads, and I chose the path that included you.

 And you know what kills me? While I was making that decision,

 you were off sleeping with my best friend. That was fun. I've

 been kind of down lately. Nothing like a little retail therapy. Yes,

 I'd say you had a real breakthrough around the fourth shoe store.

 Please tell me Carlos isn't having an affair with a tiny naked

 person. Celia! Juanita! Oh, my God. What the hell are you doing?

 Playing with my new doll. Look, she can leap off of cliffs!

 No! No. This is not your doll! Then whose is it? I

 found it in your closet. Oh, my God. Where's her arm? Where's

 her arm? Oh! For God's sakes. Celia, this is not a toy.

 Yeah, it is. No! It's not. It's something special that belongs to

 me! It is mine! And no one can take it away from

 me! I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Is everything okay in here?

 Mommy's mad because we played with her doll. Go to your room.

 Go. Both. Your doll? Of course it's not mine. It's a gift

 for Bob and Lee. They're adopting a little girl. Let me get

 your discharge papers and I'll be back to wheel you out. Thank

 you. Hey, Mike's bringing the car around front. I will get your

 bag. Hey, what is that on your arm? Did you get a

 blood test? I just wanted to see... I am not taking your

 kidney! Relax, I wasn't a match. But if I was and I

 didn't check, I never would've forgiven myself. Come here. You know, when

 you were growing up, sometimes I felt like I was just winging

 it. And then I see the incredible woman you've become, and I

 know I did something right. Where's my daughter? Did they move her?

 I'm telling you, it's the other end of the hall. I'm here!

 Oh! Hello, sweetie. What're you doing? Well, you're getting discharged today and

 I came to help. -Let me take that bag. -No. I wouldn't

 want you to pull something and not be able to play shuffleboard

 on your cruise. Well, how about I take us all out for

 a nice lunch? I can't. I'm on a restricted diet. And MJ's

 waiting for me at home. I like to be there for my

 child. Come on, let's go. Let me at least push your chair.

 I'm good. Susie, I want to help. You do not get to

 \"help\" by pushing my wheelchair. You had your chance to help. Susan,

 be fair. No! How could you refuse to even be tested? My

 own mother. Julie couldn't wait to hand over one of her kidneys!

 Well, there you go. Problem solved. I wasn't a match. That is

 not the point. You only had a 15% chance of being a

 match. That meant there was an 85% chance that I'd never know

 how little you cared about me. I could've gone the rest of

 my life thinking you were a wonderful mother who had the wrong

 kind of kidney. Now wait a second here... No, no, no, no.

 Claire, it's okay. I am sorry I disappointed you, honey. Hey. Can

 we talk for a minute? That depends. Are you alone? Yes. Then

 we can talk. Do you want to come in? That depends. Do

 you have beer? Yes. Then I'll come in. I need a favor.

 I want you to let your mom off the hook. No way.

 I'm done with her. Susan, there are some things you don't know.

 Like what? What could you possibly tell me that would excuse her

 behavior? I'm her daughter. This is my hour of need and she's

 not even trying to help. No, I'm not gonna forgive her for

 this. Ever. She has cancer. What? Breast cancer. They caught it early

 and we'll see how it goes. She's starting chemo next week. What

 about the cruise? That is the cruise. That's the story we're telling

 because she didn't want you to know. And that's why she can't

 give you a kidney. Okay, why wouldn't she tell me? This doesn't

 make sense. You know Mom. I mean, since when has she passed

 up a chance for attention? Exactly. When she heard about what you've

 been going through, she decided, no, not this time. She wasn't going

 to burden you. And I jumped all over her. I've got to

 go talk to her. No, no. Don't tell her you know. -Why

 not? -Susan, please. Respect what she's trying to do here. She's trying

 to make up for a lifetime of me-me-me. Let her. Oh, dear.

 This is why people should never let children play with dolls. But

 don't worry. I'll have Princess Valerie all sewn up and good as

 new by the end of the day. Thank you so much. Can

 I ask you something? Of course. Am I weird for being so

 attached to a doll? I only bought her because I thought she

 was beautiful and she reminded me of someone. But lately... I'm starting

 to feel like I need her. She calms me down when I

 get upset, and I enjoy spending time with her. The thought of

 leaving here without her is really upsetting. That's crazy, right? Come with

 me. You know, what you've been feeling is absolutely normal. Well, tell

 that to my friend, Bree. I was holding that doll and she

 looked at me like I was insane. Most people will never understand.

 But I do. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Mrs.

 Humphries. I saw her in a window in a tiny shop in

 Ohio and fell in love. And the more time we spent together,

 the more I got to know her story. Her story? Of course.

 Every doll has a story. And it turns out Mrs. Humphries started

 her own business, just like I did. She has a music shop

 and she teaches piano. And she told you that? Gabby, dolls don't

 talk. But even so, Mrs. Humphries is always there for me. You

 see, her sister passed away around the same time mine did. Ever

 since, she's brought me such happiness. Isn't it funny how a doll

 can do that? And the best thing is, they'll never leave you.

 So, what's your doll's story? I don't know... Oh, of course you

 do. Tell me. Her name is Princess Valerie. She's a princess. But

 she wasn't always one. Really? When she was born, there was a

 mix-up and she was given to the wrong family. Nobody knew for

 a long time. But then one day she finally found her way

 home. From that day on, Princess Valerie never left the palace. Her

 real mother kept her hidden away so no one would take her.

 And they were never separated ever again. I know I'm not sleeping

 in here tonight. Tonight? Look... I am unbelievably sorry about this. I

 wanted to tell you so many times. But I could never find

 the right moment. Really? In 20 years of marriage, there was never

 a lull in the conversation for you to say, \"Hey, guess who

 I slept with?\" When would have been a good time? The day

 I found out you were pregnant with Porter and Preston? Parker's first

 birthday party? The morning that Penny took her first steps? We have

 had such beautiful moments together. I didn't want to ruin a single

 one of them. I hope you can forgive me for this. It

 would be a shame... A shame if some meaningless encounter 20 years

 ago ruined this wonderful life that we have built together. Susan. I'm

 sorry I didn't call first. You're not busy, are you? I'm just

 packing. My cab's gonna be here soon. So you have time to

 talk? Sure. I just wanted to apologize for yesterday. No need. This

 is a horrible time for you. And you've got so much on

 your mind. It's not that horrible. And the doctors are very optimistic.

 We're going to find a donor. I'm not worried. Oh! I'm so

 relieved. You know what the one good thing about having a health

 scare is? No. What? It makes you think about what the important

 things are. That's very true. We all think that we're gonna be

 here forever. That we have all the time in the world to

 say the important things. But we don't. Why don't you and I

 ever tell each other how we feel? We don't need to. We

 know how we feel. Do we? You're right. You already know how

 much I love you. And you already know that any time I

 accomplish anything, you're the first person I want to call, 'cause I

 love making you proud. And you know that no matter how much

 you make me crazy, a part of me enjoys it because it

 reminds me that nobody else has a mom like you. Yeah. I

 don't have to tell you that. Just like I don't need to

 tell you that my life began the day you were born. And

 it's been such a happy one. Aren't we lucky we already know

 those things? Yes. Yes, I'll be right down. That's the cab. You

 go. And I'll call you later. Okay. You know, one of these

 days, I would... I would like for us to take a little

 trip. Just the two of us. Oh! I'd like that. Yeah, we'll

 go someplace hot. And just lay out and drink some daiquiris. We'll

 absolutely do that. Just as soon as I'm done with my cruise.

 Yeah. No offense, Penny, but soccer is boring. Yeah, it's as boring

 as... Actually there's nothing more boring. You can tell us about it

 later. But you have to go! It's a playoff game. They're the

 best team in the league, I need your support. Oh, who cares?

 You guys suck anyway. Yeah, they may suck, but they still would

 have beaten Parker's team. Hey, Preston, how'd the baseball team do senior

 year? Shut up. At least I played. That's true. Remember that time

 he struck out five times? Yeah. By the third time the crowd

 started laughing. Yeah, that was hilarious. Your last at bat, the other

 team sat on their mitts. - That's so embarrassing. - Shameful. Come

 on, you guys, please? I got stuff to do. Like what? Stare

 in the mirror and wait for the first mustache hair? Relax, Penny.

 At least you won't have to share your snacks with us after

 the game. Okay, fine. Don't go. We're just messing with you. We're

 going. -Thank you. -Yeah. I'm even going to drive you. But I'm

 going to warn you, if you lose, you're walking home. Oh, please.

 Yeah, I'm not driving losers in my car. Does that mean you're

 not taking Preston? Here you go, ladies. Bree, that looks amazing. Thank

 you so much for putting this together. It really feels like old

 times. Well, you've been through so much, and I wanted you to

 feel loved and embraced by all the people in this room. And

 while I'm on the topic of embracing people, I have invited our

 neighbor Beth to join us. Cheese puff, anyone? Beth Young? Married to

 Paul Young? The lady with the bad hair? Oh, forget the hair.

 Her husband caused the riot! Which cost Susan a kidney! Why would

 you do this, Bree? I just felt sorry for her. The poor

 woman has been shunned by everyone in this neighborhood. Because she's married

 to a monster! So? Why should she have to suffer for the

 sins of her husband? Oh, crap. She's been talking to a priest.

 Renee, help us out. Tell her she's crazy. Actually, I'm with Bree.

 Please, you've never given Beth a chance. And speaking as the other

 new kid on the block, you guys are like the mean pretty

 girls who won't let anyone sit at your lunch table. That is

 so unfair. Who invited her? Okay, that's Beth. Now please, ladies, make

 an effort for me. I'm actually excited. I always wanted to be

 one of the mean pretty girls. Yeah, I got a delivery for

 Van de Kamp. Oh! How lovely. I don't see a card. Who

 are they from? Beats me. Must be my boyfriend. Would you mind

 setting them over there? I'll go get a tip. Is it her?

 Or can I wipe this fake smile off my face? It's a

 delivery man. Someone sent me flowers. Was it the Pope? There you

 go. Thank you. Oh, good, you made it. Hello. Ladies! Beth's here.

 You're sure this is okay? It isn't going to be awkward? Of

 course not. The girls are delighted you're here. We are going to

 have a wonderful time. That is a really good deal on potting

 soil. Yes. Well, again, I had a coupon. That is fortunate. Maybe

 I should go. No, no. The evening has just gotten started. I'm

 going to need some help in the kitchen. You, you, you, and

 you. Now. By the way, I know somebody who can really help

 you with that hair. Renee! What is wrong with you people? You

 said you'd make an effort. I am making an effort. An effort

 not to tear out my deformed kidney and cram it down her

 throat. Yeah, so Beth's feeling a little lonely these days. Why is

 it our responsibility to make her feel loved? Okay, look, I didn't

 want to bring this up, but let's talk about the last woman

 who was married to Paul Young. A woman who was in pain,

 and we ignored it. Do we really want Beth to end up

 like Mary Alice? We're back. We've decided to kick this party up

 a notch. Oh, lovely. Beth, sit here. We'll pour you some vino.

 Thank you. Is red okay? Because we have white, too. No. Red

 is fine. What in the world? Somebody lose a gun? Oh, my

 God! What is that doing there? Bree? No. I keep all my

 weapons in a locker. Let me see that. It's a .38 caliber.

 The police said Paul was shot with a .38. I think I

 finally understand why you invited me over. Meaning? I'm just thinking how

 convenient it is. A gun that may have been used to shoot

 Paul was under my pillow and now has my fingerprints on it?

 Hey, I was sitting there before you were and I didn't feel

 any gun. Yeah, speaking of convenient, you're alone in the room, we

 came back, and suddenly there's a gun under the cushion? Where would

 I get a gun? Oh, I don't know. How about the one

 you pointed at me on Halloween night? You never told us that.

 You mean the night you broke into my house and tried to

 kill my husband with a club? You never told us that either.

 I'm allowed to have a private life. The point is, she owns

 a gun just like the one that magically appeared when she was

 alone in the room. You're all in on this. You wanted to

 set me up. I can't believe you would say that to me

 after I reached out to you. Well, I think it's time I

 did some reaching out of my own. I'm calling the police. We

 don't have to get up early tomorrow. So, I was thinking maybe

 we could... I still cannot believe that I fell for Beth's act.

 Or we could talk about this some more. Well, she is just

 as twisted as that husband of hers. And I am a fool.

 You're not a fool. You're a kind and generous person. That's what

 I love about you. That and the fact you can go from

 mad to passionate in a heartbeat. I suppose you do deserve some

 loving after those beautiful flowers you sent me. At the risk of

 going to bed frustrated... I didn't send you any flowers. You didn't?

 Then where did they come from? We pass by these people every

 day. But we never look at them. We don't want to see

 the sadness in their expressions. The longing in their hearts. The loneliness

 in their eyes. But there are times we should stop and look

 at these isolated people. Why? Well, if we look close enough, we
