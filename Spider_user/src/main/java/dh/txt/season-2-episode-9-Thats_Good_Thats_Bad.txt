 on Desperate Housewives: All this time my father has been right across

 town running the feed store? Susan found her real father... Ed wants

 to make the final decision. Ed Ferrara, Lynette Scavo. ...Lynette met her

 new boss... I learned my lesson. When I get out, everything's gonna

 be different. ...Carlos promised to change his old ways... Dr Goldfine has

 concerns about us being together. I think he's right. ...Bree discovered George's

 true colours. George, I don't want to! We are engaged! You have

 to wear it! I don't think we are anymore. Anyone who'd ever

 been to a party at Bree Van De Kamp's thought of her

 as the perfect hostess. Because Bree knew how to take care of

 her guests. Her dinners were always served promptly, her liquor always flowed

 freely, and her anecdotes were always enjoyable. But on this night, the

 perfect hostess was about to find herself... Where's that music coming from?

 ...in a very imperfect predicament. I'm not sure. Don't give up on

 us, baby We're still worth one more try If you'll excuse me

 for just one minute. I know we put a last one by

 Just for a rainy evening George! I have guests! What do you

 think you're doing? We had a tiff. I upset you. I'm trying

 to make things right. It was not a tiff. We broke up.

 It's over! We can still come through If you don't knock it

 off, I'm gonna call the police! All right, go ahead. I really

 lost my head last night Call the police! If they tow me

 away, I'll come back! I want you to hear the whole medley!

 Come on! Why don't you all take your seats? Dessert is about

 to be served. I really lost my head last night You've got

 a right to... Yes, Bree knew how to take care of her

 guests. Especially those who weren't invited. Good guys wear white hats, and

 bad guys wear black. This is how children distinguish between good and

 evil. But they soon learn the bad guys don't always look so

 bad. In fact, sometimes they even seem downright friendly. That is, until

 you get to know them a little bit better. Hey. Fancy seeing

 you here. I was just out for a little ride. Don't lie.

 You've been riding up and down this street for the last hour.

 I don't want to do this but you won't return my phone

 calls. So, stalking me is \"Plan B\"? Bree, I know I messed

 up. I know I got some issues to work on. But I'd

 be willing to see a therapist, if that's what you want. I'll

 do anything. But how can I show you I can change if

 you don't give me a second chance? Come on. You know I'm

 not a bad person. I do know that. But I'm just not

 sure you're a good one, either. And we integrated the corporate logo

 into the jungle background, creating not only an ad for the clothing

 but for the company itself. I don't get it. What don't you

 get? The whole idea kind of makes my head hurt. - Is

 it just me? - No. You're right. It stinks. Sorry guys. Back

 to the drawing board. I've got tickets to a game. Nina, do

 whatever you have to do to keep us afloat. You got it.

 Looks like it's gonna be another late night at the office. Nice

 work, everybody, thank you. Could you can the attitude, Nina? What did

 you just say? You're being rude. It's out of line. You know

 how hard we all worked. Yeah, I do. Nina, I think I

 speak for everyone here when I say we are sick and tired

 of your abuse. Frankly, you owe us an apology. Is this true?

 I mean, I would be mortified if I thought that I'd hurt

 any of you. If anybody feels like I owe them an apology,

 please... speak up. You? You? You? Gee, Lynette. I guess you were

 mistaken. All right, let's recap, shall we? Stinky pitch. Working late. No

 apologies. Guys, we talked about this! What happened to standing up for

 ourselves? Hot muffins! Any takers? No, Stu. These people don't deserve muffins.

 Hello? Hello. My name is Mark Martinez. I'm the assistant warden at

 Fairview County Jail. Is Mrs Solis available? Yeah, this is her. Did

 something happen with Carlos? At 7.43 this morning your husband held two

 guards at gunpoint, then successfully escaped. He what? I take it you

 had no prior knowledge he had planned to do this? Of course

 not! He's a moron! We have every reason to believe your husband

 may come to find you. We believe him to be armed and

 very, very horny. What? Surprise, baby. I got paroled early. It's so

 good to see you! What happened? There's this church group that helps

 out Catholic prisoners, and they really stepped up for me. What did

 they do? They lobbied the parole board and it worked. I owe

 the Pope a \"thank you\" note. Less talking. More stripping. Prudy's Feed

 Store. Apparently he owns the place. - How are you gonna do

 it? - What do you mean? How are you gonna tell him

 that you're his daughter? Oh, I'm not. The man abandoned me before

 I was born. I don't have a desire to have a relationship

 with him. OK, then I'm really confused why we're here spying on

 him. I just want to see what he's like. And satisfy my

 curiosity and get it out of my system. Well, there you go.

 Now, you tell Charlie that Addison Prudy says, \"Drop in sometime.\" I

 miss that ugly mug of his around here. I will. I bet

 I know what you're here for. You heard about the giveaway. Well,

 I got the cowboy hats right here. Oh, no, that's OK, you

 don't have to give me anything. Really. Relax. This is a promotional

 item. Didn't cost me a dime. There you go. Pretty as a

 picture. I have a dad! He's great! He gave me a hat!

 Wow. That biting thing, at the end, totally blew my mind. Please

 tell me you didn't learn that in prison. Yeah, dude. Wait, I'm

 not done with you yet. Just gimme ten minutes please. What is

 wrong with you? You're totally useless after sex. I know. I should

 probably get my thyroid checked out. Who's Sister Mary Bernard? Hey, those

 are private. Gimme. She's this nun, OK? She visited me in prison.

 She's part of the group that got me early release. Can I

 have them back? \"When you walk with God every day, you learn

 that truth is understood in the mind, but faith burns in the

 heart.\" You don't know what it was like in there, all right?

 Twenty hours a day, eight by ten cell, just you and your

 mind. So, pretty much, just you. It forces you to re-examine everything.

 I was a very bad person for a very long time. But

 now all that is gonna change. Because I'm on a new path.

 A new path? I am gonna live a virtuous life. I want

 to do right by you, by my mama, and by my god.

 What the hell did they do to you in that prison? All

 right, this is my last hand, and then I gotta go. Already?

 I left a proposal on my desk at work. I have to

 go over it tonight or you-know-who's gonna have my head. Nina! This

 \"gainful employment\" thing is starting to cut into our social life. If

 one of you would agree to raise my kids, I wouldn't need

 a job. Any takers? No, I didn't think so. Ante up. Speaking

 of child abandonment, when are you gonna tell your father he has

 a bouncing middle-aged baby girl? Soon. I don't want to ambush him.

 I'm gonna ease into it. How do you ease into \"Hi! I'm

 your illegitimate daughter\"? There's a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window. I

 was thinking about getting a job there. He would get to know

 me, and I'm sure he would like me, and I would like

 him, and then one day he'd say, \"You're like the daughter I

 never had.\" And I'd say, \"Well, now that you mention it...\" OK,

 I'll go first. That's the most idiotic plan I've ever heard of.

 Why? Because it all hinges on him responding to your personality. And

 let's face it. You are an acquired taste. Edie, I'm sure Susan's

 father will like her just fine. Thank you. I just hope you

 don't expect too much from this relationship. You might find that you

 don't have much in common. I know. But I've got to find

 out if there's something there. I've always wanted a dad. I mean,

 I know not having one affected me. Of course it did. Everyone

 needs a strong male role model. No, they don't. I grew up

 without a father. It didn't affect me. Edie, how old were you

 when you lost your virginity? Point well taken. Hey, look what I

 found in Ed's fridge. Hey, Stu. And Nina... Hey, Lynette. Can I...

 see you for a sec? Sure. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Having sex with

 the support staff. That's a big no-no. Ed's been known to fire

 people for that sort of thing. Lynette, I know that we've had

 our little differences. But at the core, I believe that we're both

 good people, both smart women who are just trying to make it

 in this vicious, male-dominated jungle... OK, what do you want? Do you

 want a raise? You want a better office? My demands are simple.

 I want you to be nicer. What? No more belittling, berating, rude

 sarcasm. And in exchange I get your silence? Yeah, pretty sweet deal,

 don't you think? I'll see what I can do. - Great. -

 OK. And I'm gonna take your parking space. I kid the Nina!

 You're up early. I'm going to Mass. Yeah. But it's not even

 Sunday. They have Mass every day of the week. Really? When did

 they start doing that? That's Sister Mary Bernard. Did you see where

 I put my Bible? What? - I saw your nun. - So?

 So she's hot. She's a hot nun. You can't seriously be jealous.

 You mean to tell me that this miraculous conversion of yours has

 nothing to do with the fact that the woman standing outside is

 a knockout? That's what I'm telling you. Who are you here to

 see? I'm Lynette Scavo. I work here. Who are you? Pat. It's

 my first day. Oh. Well, welcome. What happened to Stu? You fired

 Stu? Oh, Lynette. Hey. Come on in. I can't believe you would

 sink so low. I'm going to Ed. Ed knows. This is Stu's

 employee evaluation file. Right here. This thing is full of black marks.

 Come on. We both know why you got rid of him. Well,

 good luck proving it. Oh, and on a completely unrelated topic, there's

 gonna be another round of firings coming down the pike. Ed's been

 after me to trim the fat. You threatening me? No, no. It's

 just that it's gonna be my job to evaluate those who are

 team players and those who are not. Just a little heads up.

 Just trying to be nice. I don't know, you seem kind of

 overqualified. Why? Because I went to college? Because you finished high school.

 Well, I just wanna change my life, and ever since I was

 a little girl I've always liked horses and the outdoors and well,

 I'm just fascinated with feed. Well, I suppose we could give you

 a try. What? Something on my nose? Oh, no... I was just

 looking at the colour of your eyes. You were? Yeah. They're just

 like mine. They're... They're nice. Carol sent you to test me, didn't

 she? What? Who's Carol? You go back and tell my wife if

 a private detective couldn't fool me, you're not gonna either. I don't

 know what you're talking about. A cute little thing like you struts

 in here, flirts with an old codger like me? How dumb do

 you think I am? Hey, look at ya. You got pretty hair,

 you got a sexy walk, you got a tight little ass... I'm

 your daughter! What? Back in the '60s you had a brief... ...relationship

 with a young girl, Sophie Bremmer. She got pregnant, and had a

 baby, and that baby was me, which makes you my father. Hi.

 I'm sorry, I didn't want to spring it on you like this.

 Where are you going? You see, when I found out you were

 alive and we both lived in the same city, I just wanted

 to meet you. Mr Prudy? Mr Prudy? Hello? Hello? And, knock wood,

 the doctors say I'll keep improving. Slowly but surely. So, how are

 you? Good, good. I'm seeing friends. I just started co-chairing a charity

 event for the Junior League. And... and I broke up with George.

 Really. Dr Goldfine, do you ever really cure people? I mean, even

 if they're really crazy? I'm not a big fan of that word.

 People either have mental health or they don't. When they do have

 a problem, you treat them as if they had any other disease,

 and sometimes they get better. Well, when I broke up with George

 I saw something in his eyes. It was a kind of malevolence,

 and it didn't seem to me to be the sort of thing

 that you could cure. I don't believe in evil. We're just people.

 How can you not believe in evil? A man threw you off

 a bridge for no reason. Exactly. He didn't know anything about me.

 He just rode up on his little blue bike and tried to

 hurt me. Do I think he's wicked? No. He's disturbed. His problems

 probably stem from a chemical imbalance. I believe with enough time and

 treatment I could help him. Did you say \"a blue bike\"? Black?

 Great. I gotta say, Lynette, I was surprised to get your call.

 I didn't think you'd notice I was fired. Of course I noticed.

 You are one of my favourites. And I thought it was really

 unfair how it all went down. It wasn't that unfair. I was

 late all those times. And I broke the copier. I stole all

 those paper clips. See, I don't think that's why you got fired.

 Really? That's what Nina said. Word got out that you and Nina

 were... Shagging? Well, being intimate. And Nina fired you to keep Ed

 from finding out. You're kidding. And that wasn't right of her. She

 shouldn't have been having sex with you. She's upper management. Technically, it's

 sexual harassment. But I was into it. I consented. Stu, you're a

 gofer. You can't consent to anything. So I think you should talk

 to Ed about getting your job back. Why would he care? Oh,

 he'll care. He doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars.

 Wow. So would Nina get in trouble? Well, I'm not gonna lie

 to you. There is a possibility she'd get a... ...slap on the

 wrist. So... ...you'll think about talking to Ed? Definitely. The nurse told

 me you were waiting. I just wanted to see if you were

 OK. Sorry if I spooked you. I've got a bad heart. It's

 genetic, so you might wanna get that checked. OK. Look, don't take

 this wrong, but, I need you to clear out. What? I just

 got here. My wife's on her way. The thing is, if Carol

 finds out I've got an adult love child running around, that's gonna

 be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I mean, it's not

 exactly the only time I've strayed. Charming. But believe me, it was

 nice to finally get to meet you. You're a lovely woman. Hon,

 you really need to leave now. It's Susan. My name is Susan.

 And... no, I... That's not good enough. Look, I'm... I'm trying really

 hard to be nice about this, but you're backing me into a

 corner. It's not like I want an invitation to Thanksgiving. I just

 wanna have coffee or a lunch now and then. I can't start

 up something with you. It wouldn't be fair to my wife. All

 the times you were cheating on her, that was OK, but having

 lunch with your daughter, that crosses the line? I just want a

 chance to get to know you. Well... I don't want to know

 you. I've already got a family. Years ago, your mother and I

 came to an understanding. I gave her a bunch of money and

 she agreed to keep things quiet. Well, I wasn't consulted on that

 little arrangement. I don't think it's fair to punish me for a

 mistake I made years ago! Is that what you think of me?

 I'm a mistake? If that's what you need to hear? Yeah. That's

 what I think. Oh, Addy! Addy! Are you OK? I'm good, baby.

 The kids are on their way over. Hi. I'm Carol. You are?

 Do you want to tell her, or should I? I'm your husband's

 guardian angel. Excuse me? My name's Susan. I was buying some horse

 feed when Mr Prudy had an attack behind the counter. I gave

 him CPR and called 911. Thank you. Thank you. When I think

 what could have happened... Well, I'm gonna get out of here. Mr

 Prudy, I want you to hurry and get back on your feet.

 I'm not giving up. I'm gonna be back in the store next

 week. I never got that darn horse feed. I guess I'll put

 a bag aside for you. You do that. Bree, it's me. The

 police are at my house. What the hell is going on? Look,

 I know you're there, pick up. Did you have anything to do

 with this? Bree? Bree? George, I know what you did to Dr

 Goldfine. And I can see now just how sick you really are.

 So, please, just turn yourself in and that way you can get

 the help that you really need. George? What's going on? Oh, I

 invited Sister Mary Hotpants over for lunch. What? You said she touched

 your soul. I want to make sure her hands are clean. So,

 Sister Mary, tell me, what's it like meeting men in prison? You

 bond with all the convicts or was Carlos just special? Well, of

 course Carlos is special. But our mission does a tonne of evangelical

 work with several prisons. Oh, I get it. Sort of like, today's

 convict is tomorrow's convert. Something like that. But mostly I do charity

 work. Are you two involved in any charities? Currently? No. But we

 should be. Gabby, buying more stuff isn't gonna make our lives better.

 Exactly. Money can't buy happiness. Sure it can. That's a lie we

 tell poor people to keep them from rioting. - Gabby! - It's

 a joke! Lighten up. Can you believe this? I'm married to a

 woman so selfish she makes fun of charity. You are a hypocrite.

 The money to buy your car could buy a mud hut for

 every peasant in Ecuador. OK, you're right. But I am evolving, starting

 right now. I would like to donate my car to your mission.

 What? Carlos, are you sure? Absolutely. Gabrielle and I don't need two

 cars. We can share one. Share? What if you have the car

 and I need to go shopping? We're gonna cut back on shopping

 too. OK, I think we should just calm down a little bit.

 I'm gonna get you that pink slip right now. - Carlos! -

 We're doing this. I have to... Here, have some of this. No

 one needs to know. Don't even bother. You're not talking me out

 of this. I'm not here to talk you out of anything. Check

 in this drawer. Carlos, I wanna apologise for the way I've been

 acting. I mean, here you are, trying to turn your life around,

 and all I can think about are my stupid jealousy issues. Yeah,

 well, let's just get back down there. No, I mean it, I'm

 sorry. I wanna be a better person too. I'm sick of being

 bad. Forgive me? You're not a bad person. Really? No, of course

 not. That's so sweet. I feel so close to you right now.

 Gabby. I'm sorry, I guess I am bad. But, we got a

 nun downstairs. She can wait five minutes. We're giving her a car.

 - Here. Here. - OK. - Hey, Pat, what's going on? -

 I'm not sure. Ed keeps calling people into his office. I think

 people are getting fired. Lynette? Yeah. Lynette... ...Nina's out, you're in. You're

 our new VP of accounts. I... am? I gave her the axe,

 along with other people. Why? What happened? Our pal Stu filed a

 sexual harassment suit against the company. He did what? Hired a fancy

 lawyer who threatened to go to the press. I had no choice

 but to pay him off. He had a video of him and

 Nina together. OK, I get Nina. But why are you firing everybody

 else? Stu's taking us to the cleaners. If I don't cut back,

 the next round of paycheques are gonna bounce. Oh, God. Ed, I

 am so sorry. It's not your fault. We'll get through this. You

 and me, together. Can you run to the art department? Someone's got

 to can Jeff and Elizabeth. Yeah! Sure, I'II... I'm gonna go and

 take care of that. Hey. Congratulations. This... ...is not what I wanted.

 I just wanted you to be nicer. You know what? I used

 to be nice. But our boss... I'm sorry, your boss... ...is incompetent

 and selfish and has the attention span of a poodle. I mean,

 from day one, I've been the only one around here keeping this

 place from crumbling down around his stupid ears. Oh, Nina, come on.

 This is the truth, here. \"Nice\" is a luxury that I gave

 up along with vacations, and relationships, and eating at home. This job

 sucks you dry. So you better kiss those four little kiddies of

 yours goodbye. Because you have just adopted the neediest little child in

 the world. Here. You're gonna need this more than I do. Hi.

 Carlos will be down in a little while. We had an intense

 talk. He's resting. Yeah, I overheard some of your...\"talk\". Sorry. He's such

 an animal. But since we have a couple minutes, why don't we

 chat? Look, I don't mean any disrespect. It's just, now that Carlos

 is home, we need to get back on our routine. And we

 can't do that if he keeps running off to church and charity

 bake sales. We need \"us\" time. Do you know what I mean?

 I do. Oh, good, good. So it would really help our marriage

 if you just backed off for a while. OK? No. I said

 no. I know what you said. I'm wondering why you said it.

 Carlos is a diamond in the rough. A flawed man, to be

 sure, but someone desperately searching for something to believe in. To satisfy

 your materialism, he ended up breaking the law. To deal with your

 adultery, he resorted to assault. As long as he's with you, he

 will never find what he's looking for. He should have thought of

 that before he married me. Some marriages are meant to be annulled.

 What the hell kind of nun are you? If you try to

 come between me and my husband, I will take you down. I

 grew up on the South Side of Chicago. If you want to

 threaten me, you're gonna have to do a lot better than that.

 You listen to me, you little bitch. You do not want to

 start a war with me. I have God on my side. Bring

 it on. You called for a bellman? There's a charity dinner taking

 place downstairs. My friend, Bree Van De Kamp, is one of the

 co-chairs. Give her this note and walk away. If she comes up

 in the elevator, call me. Do you think you can do that?

 Yes, sir. Excuse me, ma'am? - Yes? - I was asked to

 give this to you. Oh, thank you. Barton. This is Bree Van

 De Kamp. I need to talk to you about George Williams. I

 was getting ready to call you, Mrs Van De Kamp. My men

 are at his house now and they've uncovered evidence that suggests... ...Mr

 Williams was responsible for your husband's death. What? Yeah, we found... Rex's

 prescription bottles and doctored potassium pills, as well as some... disturbing diary

 entries. Mrs Van De Kamp? Hello, sir? Yes, she's on her way

 up. Thank you very much. She loves me. She loves me not.

 She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. Operator, this

 is a bit embarrassing, but I've... I've swallowed some pills by mistake.

 You need to call an ambulance. ...they were... they were just vitamins.

 Yes. False alarm. I'm fine. Door's open. Hey. What were you thinking,

 taking the pills? I didn't hurt Dr Goldfine. For you to... ...think

 me capable of... ...that sort of... ...violence... George? George! I'm sorry. It's

 the pills. Why are you telling me this? Because maybe I don't

 have to die. I could face the police, knowing that you would

 be there for me... ...that you'd stay my friend. Then I'll have

 something to live for. And then we'll call an ambulance and they'll

 pump your stomach? Yes. I want to help you. But in order

 to do that, I need to forgive you, and... ...I can't do

 that until you admit what you've done. I didn't push Goldfine. Yes,

 you did. But that's not what I'm talking about. You killed Rex.

 But I know it wasn't totally your fault because you're not well.

 So if you'll just be honest with me... ...I can forgive you.

 It'll be the hardest thing I've ever done, but I'll do it.

 But you have to... ...you have to tell me the truth. Look,

 I'm in trouble here. We need to call someone. Not until you

 admit what you've done. I love you. Anything I may have done,

 I did for you. Because you wanted me to. You know you

 did. We need to phone an ambulance. I... ...called them while you

 were asleep. They're already on their way. It's not always that easy

 to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. Sinners can surprise

 you. And the same is true for saints. Why do we try

 to define people as simply good or simply evil? Because no one

 wants to admit that compassion and cruelty can live side by side
