 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: On his last three trips east, he cashed in

 his first-class ticket and took a detour to Atlantic City. Lynette received

 some disturbing news... - He said it was OK to kiss her.

 - What else did your brother tell you? Caleb revealed a secret...

 Susan made a first-class confession... You're gonna leave me out here? I

 can't be around you anymore. I'm just not strong enough. And Bree

 made the most difficult decision of her life. Susan Mayer had always

 believed the one good thing about hard times is that you get

 to find out who your friends really are. When her grandmother died,

 it was Bree who brought homemade cookies. When the critics panned her

 third book, it was Gabrielle who hired the handsome masseur. When her

 divorce became final, it was Lynette who poured the Scotch. Sadly, Susan's

 life had been shattered once again. But, as always, her friends had

 come to help pick up the pieces. Susan, we've all been talking

 and we've decided you and Julie should stay with Bree. Oh, thanks.

 No, that's OK. We'll stay in a motel. Absolutely not. Just give

 me an hour to straighten up Andrew's room and then you can

 bring your... selves over. - I don't deserve friends like you. -

 We're aware of that. Susan, we're running low on trash bags. -

 I'm going to run to the store. - Thanks, Orson. Thanks for

 coming. - You know, you didn't have to do this. - Hey,

 it's my pleasure. Mrs Mayer? Hi. Bud Penrod. Town and Country Insurance.

 - \"The Can-Do People.\" - Oh, it's nice to meet you. Yeah.

 Look at that. - Well, that's no fun at all, is it?

 - No. No, it isn't. When am I gonna get the cheque?

 I have a lot of rebuilding to do. I need to get

 started. I'm afraid that's going to be a while. You see, the

 fire department has ruled that this was arson. - Arson? - Yeah.

 We can't give you any money until we finish our investigation. -

 Who'd want to burn down my house? - I don't know. Do

 you have any enemies? No! No, look, the whole neighbourhood turned out

 to help. I'm very popular. And there's no one among them that

 wishes you ill? Oh, no. No. Everybody's been very helpful. Everybody likes

 me. Absolutely... ...everyone. Yes, hard times were what Susan used to distinguish

 who was a friend and who wasn't. Not everyone enjoys being a

 small part of a large community. Indeed, some yearn to leave the

 stress and noise of constant companionship behind them. So they strike out

 on their own, hoping their solitude will bring a little peace and

 quiet. It's only then they discover how dangerous it is to be

 alone in the world. Zach? Did you get the trash? - How'd

 you get in here? - Hi, Paul. I stood at the back

 door shouting. Were you in the little boys' room? - I'm calling

 the police. - I needed to borrow some flour. I'm a little

 bit psychic and I predict fresh baked cookies in your future. Zachary.

 - What did she want? - She was in the cupboard. Get

 a bag. We're throwing everything away. You think she was trying to

 poison us? All I know is, we're eating out tonight. What do

 you want? This is a little awkward, and I apologise in advance

 for how this is gonna sound, but... By any chance, did you

 burn down my house? - Yes. - What? Yes, I burned down

 your house you sleazy little whore. Edie! Why would you do that?

 Can you blame me, after sending me that acid letter? Letter? What

 letter? The one where you admitted to stabbing me in the back

 by sleeping with Karl. You weren't supposed to get that. I stole

 that back from the mailman. So you were trying to hide the

 truth from me? This is not what we should focus on right

 now. The point is, you maliciously set fire to my house. Look,

 I admit I might have overreacted a tad. A tad? Edie, I

 have no roof! You can't just go around burning down people's homes!

 Why not? You burned down my home. You stole Mike from me.

 You slept with my fianc?! That's the trifecta. You're lucky I didn't

 torch your car. That's it. I'm going to the police and I'm

 telling them what you did. Did what? I didn't do anything. What?

 You just confessed. No, I didn't. Did anyone else hear me confess?

 Hello? Hello? No witnesses... ...no evidence, no confession. I guess we're done

 here. You can go home now. Oh, wait. That's right. You don't

 have one. No, no, Xiao Mei, I've told you a million times.

 No red meat for Mr Solis. My triglycerides are through the roof.

 Sweetie, I need some more cream. Xiao Mei, what's wrong? - She

 smell. - Who smells? Gabby? Excuse me, what? - Her perfume make

 me sick. - Honey, it's a 100 bucks an ounce. That tends

 to make everyone a little nauseous. Xiao Mei, your boobs, are they

 tender? Carlos! Her boobs are none of your business! Gabby, think. She's

 sensitive to smell, nauseous, and has swollen breasts. Well, I just ran

 her blood work. Looks like the insemination was successful. Oh, my God!

 We're going to have a baby! Now, you should know, since she

 is experiencing early symptoms, this might be a tough pregnancy for her.

 Not a problem. We're gonna treat her like a queen. Absolutely. You

 have nothing to worry about here. - Oh, Mrs Solis, you smell.

 - Yeah, OK, sorry. It's going to be a kick having Susan

 and Julie stay with us. It'll be like living in a sorority.

 We'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores. Doesn't that

 sound like fun? Why are you pretending to be happy? I heard

 you walking around your room all night long. Crying. I don't want

 to talk about it. Look, I know why you're worried, but Andrew

 can take care of himself. And, if he can't, he shouldn't have

 run away. Know what? Maybe Andrew leaving will be good for us.

 You are all I have left and I am gonna be the

 best mother that I can be. There's definitely room for improvement. It's

 just... ...you kind of forgot my birthday. - What? - Yeah. It

 was six weeks ago. Oh, my God, Danielle. I'm so sorry! It's

 OK. You had a lot going on. I mean, Andrew was suing

 you, and you were pretty wasted that month. Honey, you got to

 let me make it up to you. I'm gonna throw you a

 birthday party with all your friends, OK? That could be cool. -

 You know what else I'd like? - Name it. It's yours. I

 want Andrew's room. You said he's probably not coming back. And I

 could use the extra closet space. But, sweetheart, this is his room.

 Mom, you forgot my birthday. You're really in no position to negotiate.

 Honey, where am I gonna put all of his things? And, you

 know, he might come back at some point. He won't. Like you

 said, I'm all you have left. - Atlantic City? - Yeah, it's

 last minute, but Jerry got a deal on a suite at one

 of the casinos and a bunch of the old gang is coming

 in from New York. And, God, it's been forever since I've been,

 - so how could I turn that down? - Yeah. How, indeed?

 - What? - I didn't say anything. No, but you have that

 look. - Is something wrong? - No. I know you've been to

 Atlantic City three times in the last month without telling me. Ed

 found receipts when he did the audit. Other than that, no, nothing's

 wrong. It would be better for your well-being if you did not

 laugh at this moment in time. Am I gonna have to ruin

 the surprise? Because it's a really good surprise. I'm thinking, yeah, ruin

 it. I have been going to Atlantic City for business. I'm up

 for a top spot with Jerry's firm, Huffington Promotions. And if you

 don't believe me, you can call the CEO himself. I am so

 happy... and I'm so relieved. - Did you think I was cheating?

 - No! Absolutely not. - Lynette... - No! OK, a little bit.

 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ed found receipts for flowers and theatre tickets.

 - I mean, by the way, did you... - Jerry and I

 went to a show, and the flowers were for Milt's wife. I

 knew that. You didn't have to tell me that. - Why'd you

 buy flowers for Milt's wife? - Lynette. Sorry. Stop. Done talking. That's

 fantastic. - I love you. - I love you. Carlos... What's going

 on? Xiao Mei was feeling under the weather so I took up

 the vacuuming. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you move my beauty

 products? They're not in the bathroom. Why in the hell... I forgot

 to tell you. You can't use that stuff anymore. It triggers Xiao

 Mei's morning sickness. All of it? Even my hair pomade? - Gives

 me stomach ache. - Well, it gives me volume. So I guess

 we're both gonna have a problem. - Do you have to be

 high-maintenance? - You married a model. - Maintenance is my only skill.

 - Please. No fight. If Mrs Solis smell bad, I be OK.

 Fine. I'll learn to live without product. But when my hair starts

 smelling like hair, I don't wanna hear a word. Surprise! - What

 the hell is that? - Isn't it darling? I made it for

 your party. It's a big one and a big seven. For 17.

 - Were you up all night making that? - Yeah, I just

 wasn't tired. I want to show you what else I have planned.

 I think you're gonna love it. - You got a fajita bar

 and a juggler? - Relax. He's a very hip juggler. He only

 performs to Beatles songs. I saw the video and it's thrilling. Mom,

 I don't want any of this stuff. - It's not my real

 birthday. - Danielle, I just want you to have the best party

 you have ever had in your entire life. I just want a

 few friends to come over and hang out. You can make a

 cake, but giant balloon numbers? I mean, come on, they would all

 make fun of me. OK. Is that really necessary? Honey, I can't

 possibly put it in the garbage as is. It's just another morning

 with the Van De Kamps. Oh, Susan. Did I wake you? No.

 No, I was up. Well, I'm sorry about the noise, it's just

 that Danielle doesn't want balloons and I'm kind of pressed for time.

 Bree, are you OK? She said she doesn't want balloons. I'm fine.

 Mom. Look, I know you're out there. Please just talk to me.

 Mom, I need something to drink. Just some water, juice. Something, anything.

 Please. Mom! You want me to say I set Caleb up? Yeah,

 I did it. I started thinking about all those years... Years that

 we had to take care of him. I just thought, maybe, once

 he was gone... ...we could have a normal life. And I'm sorry.

 But Mom, you have got to let me out of here... now.

 Matthew! You were willing to stand by and let me murder your

 brother without reason. That's an unforgivable betrayal. I am so consumed with

 rage, it's best you stay in there, because if I let you

 out, I don't know what I might do to you. - Hello?

 - I need Edie to spill her guts. What do you know

 about wearing a wire? You see that little red light? It's all

 voice-activated, so if the light's on, you're recording. - Let me show

 you how to tape it on. - Oh, OK. Sorry if my

 hands are cold. No. That's OK, they're fine. You sure you wanna

 do this? Yeah. I'm sort of up against a wall. The insurance

 company needs proof fast. Things are sort of weird at Bree's. I

 don't want to overstay my welcome. Well, if things get tough, you

 can always stay here. Testing, testing. I'm sorry, did you just invite

 me to move in with you? Well, you and Julie, in the

 spare bedroom. You've... You've been saying how you wanted to be friends

 again, and you're right. There's no reason we can't be friends. You

 sure that won't put a crimp in your dating life? - That

 girl you were at the movies with? - No, that was a

 one-time thing. What about that guy though, \"Orson\"? Yeah, he just heard

 about the fire and came over to help. We're friends. - So...

 neither of us is dating anybody? - Guess not. - I got

 my boarding pass. - Do what you need to do. Don't worry

 about the kids. I'll keep them out of trouble. Is this crazy?

 Following Tom across the country just to spy on him? If he

 knew I was doing this... God, I don't think I can go

 through with this. No, look, there's probably nothing going on, - but

 you need to know the truth. - Do I? I'm happy. I

 mean, I was. Why don't I look the other way and pretend

 nothing's wrong? - Lots of women can do that. - We both

 know you're not one of them. And what if I see him

 with another woman? What then? I own a gun. - You OK

 in here? - I'm fine. Why? It's just people have been asking

 about the cake and you've been icing it for over an hour.

 I just keep messing it up. I don't know what's wrong with

 me. You're probably just tired. My mom and I heard you up

 all night. It just keeps coming out too thick. You know, people

 aren't gonna care if the icing isn't perfect. People care about details.

 Someday, when Danielle looks back, I want her to remember just how

 perfect her cake looked, and how hard her mother worked to make

 her happy. This cake is a symbol of my love. Well, it

 looks delicious. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday,

 dear Danielle Stop! One of the candles went out. We're going to

 have to do this again. I'm sorry, I'll be right back! -

 Mom, it's all right. - Sweetheart, this is your special day. All

 of your candles should be lit. It'll just take me two seconds.

 Is she serious? Welcome to my own private hell. That is some

 serious frosting. Alrighty... - Who touched this? - Mom, what does it

 matter? - It's just frosting. - Somebody ruined your cake, and I

 want to know who could be that thoughtless. Was it you? -

 Or you? Who was it? - Mom, please. You're embarrassing me. You!

 You look like a girl who enjoys her frosting. No! No, I

 didn't touch it! It's just a cake, for God's sakes! Will you

 please just cut it? - Mrs Van De Kamp... - I want

 to smell your breath. - It wasn't me. It was Barbie. -

 Barbie! What the hell is wrong with you? Now it's ruined! Everything

 is ruined! You can just leave that there and I'll clean it

 up later. Xiao Mei! What are you doing in our bed? I

 said she could sleep in here from now on. It's got the

 bathroom. In case she gets sick in the middle of the night.

 What's wrong with the guest bathroom? - It's too far away. -

 It's right down the hall! She needs her rest. Besides, that bed

 is much more comfortable - than the one in the guest room.

 - I know. That's why I had the movers put it in

 here, where we sleep! Maybe I go to my bed. Yes, Xiao

 Mei. That would be good. Fine, you can use our toilet. -

 Stop kicking me! - I'm trying to get comfortable. In a twin?

 Good luck. I want my bed back. We'll go buy a nice

 big one tomorrow and put it in here. OK? That's not the

 point. We are a week into this pregnancy. You're putting Xiao Mei's

 needs before mine! She's the priority. She's the mother of my child.

 Like hell she is. That is my egg. - You know what

 I mean. She's the... - Oven, Carlos. The oven. - A well-cared-for,

 well-paid oven. - It came out wrong. I'm sorry, OK? Now can

 we just get some sleep? I'm sorry. I swear I didn't mean

 to. My leg just cramped up. Where're you going? That's my pillow!

 Goodnight! Matthew! Mom, come on. - What are you doing in there?

 - Danielle, is that you? My mom found out what we did

 to Caleb. She locked me in here. - Don't worry, I'll get

 you out. - Be really careful, OK, please. I've never seen her

 like this. She's seriously lost it this time. I know a little

 something about psycho moms. Trust me, I'll be fine. Hey. - Cleaning

 up after the big party? - Yeah. You know, it's late. Why

 don't you go to bed and let Julie and I help you

 in the morning. Oh, that's OK. I can't sleep anyway. Are you

 OK? I take it you heard what happened. Yeah, when you flip

 out in front of the pep squad, word travels fast. It was

 the oddest sensation. I was fine. I mean, everything was fine. Then,

 suddenly, I was on the outside of my body, watching a woman

 who looked like me becoming a raving maniac. Bree, I'm worried about

 you. Do you think that you should see someone? No, no, I'm

 fine. I'm just tired, that's all. I need a rest and then

 I'm gonna be as good as new. OK, well, then, why don't

 you stop and go to bed? Because I can't sleep just yet.

 Why not? Because when I sleep, I dream. And when I dream,

 I keep seeing Andrew's face in that rear view mirror. OK, what

 are you talking about? Andrew didn't run away. I dropped him off

 in the middle of nowhere and told him that I couldn't be

 around him anymore and then... ...I drove off. So I just need

 a little time to forget what I've done, and then I can

 sleep again. Hey. You know, I am not even tired. So why

 don't I stay up and help you? That would be nice. -

 Hello? - Hey, you. How're you doing? Hey, great, great. How's Atlantic

 City? Are you winning some money? Oh, I'm about even. I'm heading

 back into the casino now to try my luck again. Yeah? You're

 quite a gambler. Where's Jerry? Jerry? He's right here. Hey, honey, how're

 the kids? Great. Great. They're in the daycare room. I'm looking at

 them right now. Why don't you walk in there and put them

 on the phone with me so I can say \"hi\"? OK. Sure.

 First, can I talk to Jerry? Why do you want to talk

 to Jerry? Oh, just, you know, say hello. It's been a long

 time. Wow, man, that is weird. Can you... Do you hear that

 car alarm? No. It's strange because I can hear it here and

 through the phone. Whoa. That's weird kind of feedback, you know. Physics

 can be spooky that way. Listen, I gotta go. Ed is talking

 to me, and I'll call you back later? OK. - OK, bye.

 - Bye, honey. Nine-one-one. Is this an emergency? I think so. My

 neighbour, Paul Young, has been threatening me. - Is he there right

 now? - No. Until he actually does something, there's nothing we can

 do. Well, I won't live in fear anymore. If you people refuse

 to confront him, I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

 No, Edie, wait. I don't want to fight. I know that we've

 had our differences, but we had a friendship going there. And I

 just think we owe it to ourselves to talk about what happened.

 What's there to talk about? It happened. I walked down to your

 house, had this watering can... - What? - It was filled with

 gasoline, and \"boom,\" I laughed my ass off. OK, wait, could you

 just swallow, because I couldn't really... Well, that was basically it. One

 of the best days of my life. Well, see, you were chewing,

 so I didn't really hear what you said. Could you just say

 it again? I burned your house down. - It was great. What

 do you want? - So... you then admit burning down my house...

 on purpose. You're wearing a wire, aren't you? - Open that blouse.

 - What? No! Open that blouse! You can't outrun me, Mayer. I'm

 in the best shape of my life! Well, good! Then you'll be

 prime meat picking when you go to jail! - You give it!

 - Bite me! No! Give it! No! What the hell? Nine months

 of long nights on the couch loomed before Gabrielle. She had decided

 she would not take it lying down. So she dipped into her

 supply of forbidden perfumes... ...determined that in this battle... she would be

 the one to come out smelling like a rose. I think I

 take nap now. Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out. Honey? Boys? Anybody home?

 Hey. Mrs McCluskey, excuse me. You haven't seen Lynette around, have you?

 She's not at home or answering her phone. She packed up the

 kids and the puppy and left. - Packed them up? Why? -

 She followed you to Atlantic City. She knows about your other woman.

 Boy, you're just lucky you're not my husband. Hi. OK, first, let

 me say, I'm really sorry about the yellow jackets. And, also, no

 matter how mad I am about what you did, I don't want

 to see you go to prison. So I came up with a

 solution. Why don't you come forward and tell the police that you

 saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline.

 And, if you do that, then I'll destroy the tape. Then the

 insurance company will pay the claim, and nobody gets hurt. Does that

 sound good? Come closer. - Take your stinking deal and shove it!

 - Edie... Every time something bad happens to me, you're standing nearby.

 Well, I've had it. No more pretending to be friends. When I

 get out of here, I'm going to destroy you. OK, I'm just

 gonna think that this is the meds talking, - and I'll come

 back tomorrow. - Don't bother. OK, Edie, I'm in trouble here. I'm

 sure you'll turn on the waterworks and the whole neighbourhood will come

 running. - They always do. - That's not true. Sure it is.

 You never miss an opportunity to play the victim. And you think

 just because everybody always comes to your rescue it means that you're

 loved. Well, it doesn't. It means that you're helpless. Now get out.

 Just get out. - Hey, there. - Hi. You given any thought

 to staying at my place? Oh, yeah, that. Look, I really appreciate

 the offer, but I think I'm gonna have to pass. - Really?

 - Yeah, I think it's best. I don't wanna get a rep

 around here for being a charity case. Well, I didn't mean it

 that way. This was just one friend helping out another. I know.

 But I can figure this out on my own. At least I'm

 gonna try. You know, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.

 I really am. Well, if there's anything I can do... You know

 what would be nice? Why don't you just stop over for coffee

 sometime. OK. I mean, that is, after I get running water and

 electricity again. And a coffeemaker. I hope you're happy. That poor girl

 can hardly even come upstairs now because of you. Carlos, stop with

 the dance. It's already in the wallpaper. I swear, if anything happens

 to that kid because of you... - Oh, it's perfume, not toxic

 gas. - Why are you acting this way? Because I see the

 writing on the wall and it scares the hell out of me.

 Meaning what? The second Xiao Mei got pregnant, you have found ways

 to tell me that that baby is more important to you than

 me. - Oh, come on, Gabby. - No, men can't help it.

 When they become fathers, they become lousy husbands. And some wives don't

 mind, but you didn't marry one of those women. I don't think

 I can sleep in here tonight. The air is just a little

 too toxic. She kick you out too? Marriage is complicated, Xiao Mei.

 You'll find that out someday. You feel like watching some trashy American

 TV? I make you sandwich. Roast beef. Oh, man. Gabby's got me

 on this health kick thing. She'll kill me if I eat red

 meat. I will not tell. Taste good? Real good. Matthew, wake up,

 I have your breakfast. I might be furious with you, but never

 let it be said that I'm cruel. I advise you not to

 charge this door because I am not in the mood for any

 unpleasantness. Matthew? Matthew! I thought you were gonna steal the key! Let's

 just get out of here! Mother, Matthew and I are running away

 together and we're never coming back. If you want me to be

 happy, you won't try to find us. Living in that house with

 you was like being in a prison. You drove me to do

 this, so I hope you'll blame yourself. Have a nice life. Danielle.

 Hello, my name is Bree Van De Kamp and I'd like to

 admit myself for psychiatric observation. All right, what seems to be the

 problem? I think I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. Damn it!

 What the hell? That psychotic bitch. There was no confrontation. Felicia Tillman

 made the call! She's the anonymous tip! Let's go over there right

 now. I guarantee the woman's having a cocktail, laughing her ass off!

 We're not going anywhere yet, sir. Yes, I know there's blood everywhere.

 She probably got it from a pig so she can vandalise everything

 I own. Sergeant. - What is it? - Put your hands where

 I can see them. Man, she's good. It's a shocking moment for

 each of us. That moment we realise we are all alone in

 this world. The family we take for granted could one day abandon

 us. The husband we trust so implicitly might betray us. The daughter

 we love so deeply perhaps won't return to us. And then we

 could end up all by ourselves. Of course, some see great value

 in going it alone. For example... Sorry about the dust, Mrs Huber.

 We don't get many tourists this far up the mountain. First snows

 come, and this place is completely cut off. Dropping off the face

 of the earth. Now that's what I call a vacation. I'm sorry.
