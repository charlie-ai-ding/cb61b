 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: Mike's therapy hit a snag. - I

 don't remember! - Something happened? Who'd you see it with? - Probably

 Susan... - Why not ask her? - Mike, it wasn't a movie.

 That was us. - What? The first night we spent together. I

 saw you watching us. We were just talking. Gabby saw another side

 of Victor. I didn't marry an angry woman. I divorced one. I

 set her up in a house, gave her an allowance. I came

 and went as I pleased. I've known you two weeks. This is

 the first glimpse of a guy I could actually like. - Tom's

 back put him out of commission. - [Lynette sobbing] - It'll be

 a while. - How long? Three months. And Edie bared more than

 her soul for Carlos. I'm here, and I'm asking for a chance.

 Edie Britt had always thought of herself as passionate. Aggressively, relentlessly, violently

 passionate. Carlos Solis had always thought of himself as passionate. Romantically, spontaneously,

 constantly passionate. So it was natural for Edie and Carlos to assume

 that if they ever had sex, it would be amazing. And in

 fact, it was... Amazingly bad. - Morning. - Morning. So... last night...

 Yeah, I know. Wow. Super wow. Is that clock right? Oh, man,

 I gotta get to work. Yeah. I gotta get home. So, uh...

 So we should do this again. Oh, definitely. This week doesn't seem

 to be that great. Maybe... Next week I'm swamped. Oh. Well, we'll

 figure something out. It was at that moment Edie and Carlos had

 the exact same thought... Um... Thank you. No. Thank you. They would

 definitely be having sex again... Just not... ... with each other. It's

 so easy to spot the lonely ones. It wasn't the first time...

 They're the people who tell stories to their plants... I kinda like

 him. ... and whisper secrets to their pets. Come on! Get him

 of the court! And have arguments with their TV. He's running like

 his feet are made out of lead! And the loneliest of all,

 are the ones who talk to people. You know what I think?

 People who are no longer there. Phone's gonna ring any second. And

 it's gonna be Lynette begging me to come over early. Did I

 tell you that Tom had surgery on his back last week? Yep,

 that idiot's flat on his ass while Lynette brings home the bacon.

 Again. I shouldn't judge. Plenty of people didn't get what I saw

 in you. I won't name names... my sister Gayle. But I always

 told her that beneath all the name-calling and the dish-throwing, we really

 loved each other. [phone ringing] Bet you 50 bucks it's Lynette. Hello?

 You lose, Gilbert. What's up? I have to get to the restaurant.

 Could you come over and get the kids off to school? Why

 am I seeing pajamas? Get dressed. Yeah, they are ready to go.

 So what do you say? Oh, great. Thanks. I owe you big

 time. OK, bye. All right. I'm heading out of here. Wish me

 luck. More interviews? Yeah, but don't worry, I'm gonna find the assistant

 manager of your dreams. You sure? Because the last ten r?sum?s you

 showed me... Yeah, I know, I know. Bottom of the barrel, convicts

 and losers. You're clear about that. Make sure they know how to

 wrangle the employees. Like Kim, she never buses her tables. - I

 told you that. - Oh, you're right. Hey, honey, I had an

 idea about the specials for today... Goat cheese and mushrooms. Oh, for

 God's sake, Tom! I'm gonna be late for the interviews. I should

 go. Honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know I am driving you

 crazy. It's just that I'm feeling guilty laying here, totally worthless, while

 you run the restaurant and the house. It's OK. I am gonna

 find a way to make this all work. And you just get

 better. - [doorbell rings] - Oh, Mrs. McCluskey, perfect timing. Make sure

 you have your cell phone. While you're interviewing, I'll call, you can

 conference me in. That is a great idea. - Hi. - Hi.

 Tom's gonna ask you to look for this. You will not find

 it. Great. Love you. Here's your beer. Oh, good job, chipmunk. No

 foam this time. I tipped the glass just like you told me

 to. I think someone's ready to salt his first margarita glass. Mommy,

 do you have trouble going to sleep? No. Why do you ask?

 I heard Carlos say you were bad in bed. What? Why'd he

 say that? Do you have nightmares? OK, sweetie, I need you to

 focus. What exactly did Carlos say, and who did he say it

 to? I went to get my soccer ball from his yard. He

 was on the phone talking to someone. So what does \"bad in

 bed\" mean? Oh, it means you're not good at making... ...your bed.

 Mommy doesn't like people saying she can't make a bed. Because, trust

 me, nobody makes a bed as good as your mommy. If you

 want, I can tell people you're good in bed. [nervous laugh] No,

 no, no. That's fine, sweetie. If you want to help Mommy, just

 um... ...top off her breakfast. Susan, I'm by the orange stand, where

 are you? Cheese stand? I don't mind you going back for free

 samples, but if you like it why not just buy some? Yes,

 of course, you're right. It always tastes better when it's free. OK

 then, please hurry. Oh. Hello. Hey. Boy, you're everywhere these days. -

 Excuse me? - Yesterday, Susan and I ran into you at the

 post office. Last week, the movies. One might think you're following us.

 Trust me, \"one\" has better things to do than follow you around.

 And yet here you are... again. Ian, Fairview is a small town.

 You want distance? Move to the city. You've been awfully quiet since

 we left the market. Is everything OK? Um, well, since you asked,

 I'm having some problems at work. Really? Yes, we're in the midst

 of some corporate restructuring. I'm going to have to spend more time

 in London. Oh. OK. And, I was thinking, maybe you and I

 should just... relocate. - To London? Permanently? - I know it's sudden...

 Yeah, it's sudden! My whole life is here, my friends... Julie is

 still in school. - Susan! - [gasping] Oh, my God! Are you

 OK? I'm fine. I'm fine. OK. I can feel the car sinking.

 We're gonna have to get to shore. Ian? How deep do you

 think this water is? - Deep enough. Come on, let's move! -

 Susan... I can't swim. What? You... You said you played water polo.

 I said polo! With horses! How can you not know how to

 swim? Didn't you go to summer camp? I stayed in the canoe!

 Let it go! OK, don't panic. Just grab onto my neck and

 I'll swim for both of us. I'm twice your size! We might

 drown! Let's just stay here and think of something else. If you

 stay here, you'll definitely drown! See how my plan is better? Look,

 there's somebody on the shore! - It's Mike! He's here! - Of

 course he is. Mike! OK, OK, OK! I can walk from here!

 Sorry. You were just gripping me so tight. Oh, my God. Mike,

 you saved our lives. And our cheese! Ian, can you believe it?

 Mike saved our cheese! Yes. He's quite the hero. Yeah. Good thing

 I was following you. Arnie, thanks for coming in. We will definitely

 keep you in mind. OK... OK. Come on! What was wrong with

 that guy? He kept asking what we do with the food people

 don't eat. All right, so he's a fat loser. Who'd you expect

 to get for $8.50 an hour? That's what we pay you, and

 you seem happy. Well, that's because I'm doing the beer delivery guy.

 OK. My fault for asking. Uh... Rick Coletti? - That's me. -

 Oh, great, come on over. Your application? One second. That's been bothering

 me. Sorry. No, it's great, you can spell. You are now officially

 the front-runner. Yeah, my grandma came over from Naples. Been making calzones

 since before you were born. How old do you think I am?

 Thirty? Thirty-one? Not afraid to shamelessly ass-kiss. You're doing very well. Great.

 Wanna skip to the part where you hire me? Well, I should

 probably take a look at your application first. OK. Don't be afraid

 if you don't have experience. I realize for what we're paying, we're

 not exactly gonna get a... Whoa! You were the sous-chef at Cucina?

 - Yeah. - That's a five-star-restaurant. - Actually, four. - Which is

 four more than we have. Yeah, but this place has character and

 charm, and a beautiful owner. [chuckling] Yeah, but seriously, why would a

 four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint? Mrs. McCluskey! Mrs. McCluskey!

 I'm right here. Keep your shirt on. I need another pill. And

 please tell the kids to turn down the TV. I yell, they

 turn it down. I walk away, they turn it up. Vicious circle.

 Surely you can control five little kids. - Can I beat 'em?

 - No. Then my hands are tied. Hi, I'm home. And I've

 got good news. I found a new manager. - That's terrific. -

 Yeah. His name is Rick Coletti and he was a sous-chef at

 Cucina. Cucina? Why does he want to work at our place? Yeah,

 I had that exact same thought. And to be honest, he has

 a history. History? You know how stressful it is at a four-star-restaurant.

 He, like many chefs, started using cocaine to... - Oh, no, no,

 no. No way. - He's been clean for a year. We're not

 the Betty Ford clinic. But I've got a good feeling about this

 guy. All he wants is a fresh start. I am not gonna

 hire a junkie who's gonna turn around and then hock our jukebox

 just to feed his habit. - No, find somebody else. - I

 can't find somebody else. I've interviewed 50 guys, and this \"junkie\" happens

 to be the best. Seriously, I don't know how much longer I

 can... Can we just talk about this later? I'm in a lot

 of pain. I'm sorry. Please just do what I am asking. Fine.

 I'II, uh, keep looking. Jerk. I had a good time tonight. Who

 knew you could dance? It's one of my hidden talents. Invite me

 in. I'll show you another. Not tonight, thanks. You'd tango with a

 man, and not have sex with him? That's actually against the law

 in Argentina. Come on, we both know it's gonna happen eventually. And

 every time you say that, \"eventually\" gets a little further away. Stop

 begging or I'm not going to your rally. OK, fine. I can

 be patient. Far as I'm concerned, the chase is half the fun.

 Half the fun? Oh, honey, if I ever do say yes... ...you're

 gonna adjust that percentage way down. You can't possibly be eating more

 cheese. What, you've never heard of a midnight snack? Unless you can

 think of something else that I can nibble on. Slide over, you

 cheddar-breathed tease. [both laughing] - Oh, what's that? - It's a thank

 you gift for Mike. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we

 thank him at the shore, and when he dropped us off? I

 don't think you can thank somebody too many times for saving your

 life. I wish you'd stop saying that. - What? - That he

 saved my life. I could've survived without his help. If anybody did

 any life-saving, it was me. - You? - Yes. If I hadn't

 warned you, it would've gone through the windshield and ended up with

 an antler in your brain. Oh. Um... OK. - That's a good

 point. - Thank you. But we were in a bit of a

 jam there, and I don't think you should be embarrassed for needing

 a little help. I'm not embarrassed. I don't feel emasculated either. Emasculated?

 Who said emasculated? And why are you not kissing me now? I'm

 ready when you are. OK. I guess we're cutting right to the...

 Whoa. Wow. Don't worry. It happens to everybody. - Maybe it would

 help to talk about it. - No. I don't want to talk

 about it. All right. We won't talk about it. Want some cheese?

 Hey, how are you? I'm good. You might not think so, but

 I am good. Huh? Where in the hell do you get off

 telling people that I am bad in bed? - I never said

 that! - Travers heard you on the phone. OK, I'm sorry. I

 was talking to my cousin in Tucson. We always trade bad date

 stories. [gasping] And to think that I went out of my way

 to spare your feelings. - What's that supposed to mean? - Think

 you were bored? I've had more thrills leaning up against my dryer.

 Then what was all that moaning? I was in pain! You were

 smashing my breasts. Oh, come on. You hunkered down on me like

 you were hiding from border patrol. I was tired! You laid there

 while I did all the work. When we were done, I felt

 like I should deflate you. Yeah, well, sex is like tennis. When

 you play an inferior opponent, your game suffers. Are you challenging me

 to a rematch? - Maybe. - So you want to do it

 again? If it'll shut you up. Yeah, I'll fall on that grenade.

 Oh, there's gonna be an explosion. Come on. - [grunting] - Ow!

 Ahh! [screaming] I'm prescribing a mild painkiller for your back. And I

 will see you in a week to remove those stitches. Great. So

 how'd you folks get so banged up? Car accident? Bad sex. Really

 bad. OK. Thanks. God, what a disaster. Oh, I don't know. Maybe

 it's for the best. How so? Well, we got it out of

 our system. Now we can go back to being friends. I mean,

 we like hanging out, and Travers adores you. Yeah, and I wouldn't

 want to ruin that. Still, it doesn't make any sense. Oh, I

 know. I'm hot, you're hot. On paper, we should be having great

 sex. Well, we could always try again. Yeah, me neither. Yes, this

 town is hungry for change. When Gabrielle agreed to attend Victor Lang's

 campaign rally, she was fully prepared to be bored. I give you

 the next mayor of Fairview, Victor Lang! [crowd cheering] But when Victor

 took the stage, Gabrielle found herself strangely enthralled. Perhaps it was the

 cheers that greeted his arrival. Perhaps it was the confidence he exuded.

 Or perhaps it was the effect he had on the citizens of

 Fairview. Whatever the reason, Gabby decided, not only did Victor Lang have

 her vote... Thank you. ... it was time to make a campaign

 contribution. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. I'm afraid Mr. Lang has

 to take an important meeting in his limo. Now. To the radio

 station, Clyde. - So what's this all about? - Your speech. I

 liked it. Seriously? Here? Now? Well, you laid out all your positions.

 Don't you want to get acquainted with mine? Clyde, could you put

 up the partition? - Yes, sir. Anything else? - Music. Loud music.

 [Grateful Dead: Good Lovin'] Mrs. McCluskey! It has been ten minutes. -

 Where's my pie? - I'm unloading the dishwasher. You'll get your damn

 pie when I'm done. Mrs. McCluskey! I want my pie now. Oh,

 yeah. Yeah, you heard me. Your being here isn't charity. We pay

 you good money to help us. So when I ask you to

 do something, I want it done. Well, here's a surprise for you:

 I quit. What? What? Why? Why? What happened? Five kids are tough

 enough, but your husband makes six. - And that's where I draw

 the line. - I know Tom has been a little cranky... No,

 I'm cranky. He's insufferable. I hate to admit this, Lynette, but every

 time that man screams out in pain, I do a little jig

 inside. Look, I'll talk to Tom... - My mind's made up. -

 Wait, wait! Please! Don't do this. I am at the end of

 my rope. I wish I could help you, Lynette. I can see

 that you're going down, but I'm just too old to get dragged

 down with you. [children laughing and screaming] OK, everybody, go on up

 to bed. Parker, you got the baby. Yeah, that's exactly right. You

 know what to do. Before you speak, just know that ever since

 McCluskey left, I've been lying here feeling like the biggest jerk ever.

 Tomorrow morning I am gonna call her and apologize. I will fix

 this. Well, you might also want to apologize to the customer who

 found a Lego in her pizza. Oh, God, did the kids do

 that? I hope. Oh, God, it was so awful tonight. Oh, honey.

 You know what you need? What? A seeing to. Once the kids

 are asleep, slip on that sexy blue thing and then sneak back

 down here. You want to have sex? But you're immobile. OK, maybe

 full-on sex is a little ambitious, but there's other stuff that we

 could do. But you can't bend at the waist, and that pretty

 much leaves the heavy lifting to me. Trust me, if you get

 us to the finish line, I will cross it. Ew! Is that

 why you apologized, just so I'd service you? Honey, I have been

 trapped in this bed all day long. I'm bored, I'm miserable. Can't

 you do this one little thing for me? I have been doing

 everything I can to keep our heads above water. I can't do

 you too. For Gabrielle, the best part of having sex with a

 new man was seeing how quickly his affection would turn to obsession.

 [machine beeps] No messages. But when Victor failed to call the next

 morning... [machine beeps] No messages. ... or the next afternoon... [machine beeps]

 No messages. ... it was Gabrielle who began obsessing. Not a peep,

 in 24 hours! He's busy. Isn't he debating the mayor tonight? I

 don't care! He can find two lousy minutes! I'm here. Deal me

 in. Sorry, no poker today. Lynette had to work. Want a margarita?

 Well, I'd like three, but I'll start with one. Ms. Solis? Sorry

 to interrupt. You have any water? Yeah, in the fridge. Who is

 that? And why don't you put your water on a lower shelf?

 Thank you. That's Toby. He's fixing my closet. Has your cocky boyfriend

 gotten a load of the help? - Move away from that topic.

 - We had sex yesterday, in his limo... Oh, I love limo

 sex. Town car or stretch? Stretch, of course. I'm not a complete

 slut. The point is, he hasn't called since. - Oh. - So

 how was the sex? Fantastic. As good as with Carlos. That good,

 huh? God. I'm such an idiot. I gave it up way too

 fast. Now I've lost all the power. Oh, come on. No, I'm

 serious. Our mothers had the right idea. They let men think they

 were the ones who needed sex and women just went along as

 a favor. Men begged for every crumb, and we never lost the

 upper hand. Yeah, no guy respects an easy conquest. I make all

 my men wait. It's true. She has a little room with magazines

 and an aquarium. I have so missed our friendship. I think if

 you really like this guy, you should just be honest. Tell him

 that you feel a little hurt... Yeah, whining is really gonna bring

 him to his knees. You want to get this guy back in

 line? You hit him hard, hit him fast. Is he the jealous

 type? Aren't they all? So what should I do to make him

 jealous? I got the shelves up. Anything else? My opponent thinks we

 should combat prostitution by mounting surveillance cameras to embarrass the customers. I

 call that a blatant violation of our citizens' privacy. If you're worried

 about privacy, wear a hat, keep your head down and you'll be

 fine. [laughter] [man] OK, thank you very much, gentlemen. So let's move

 on to our next subject. You both have said our citizens pay

 too much in taxes. How would you attract new businesses to boost

 the city's tax base? Mr. Lang? Mr. Lang? I'm sorry, would you,

 uh, repeat the question, please? How would you bring new business to

 Fairview? I would, uh... ...offer tax exemptions to first year start-ups. And

 that will increase our tax base? No, of course not. Not at

 first, but when conjoined with... My opponent seems a bit overtaxed himself.

 [laughter] Gentlemen, there's been much talk lately regarding our local schools. What

 would you do to improve public education? Mr. Lang? Here you go.

 Sorry for the wait. - Miss? Please? - I will be right

 there. Oh, my God, Mrs. Scavo, I am so sorry. - Don't

 cry. Just clean. - Miss, if you... I swear, I will be

 there in one second. Here you go. Here. Yeah? Let me guess...

 This a bad time? Oh, my God, Rick. I never got back

 to you. I am so sorry. That's OK. I didn't mind waiting,

 so long as it's good news for me now. Look, I think

 you're great, and we would be lucky to have you. It's just

 my husband isn't really comfortable... With an ex-drug addict in his kitchen.

 You can drug test me every week. Anything you want. Just... I

 really need this job. - Miss! - Could you excuse me a

 second? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's up? - I hate my calzone.

 - Oh? What's wrong with it? It's just not good, and I

 want a new one. I will put your order in, but the

 kitchen's a little backed up. Not my problem. You gave me a

 sucky calzone. I don't care if you have to go back there

 and make it yourself! I can't do this. It's just... What is

 this? I'll make you a new calzone, sir. Fresh basil, garlic. You

 like sun dried tomatoes? Yeah, sounds good. Hey, is she all right?

 It's her grandma's calzone recipe. She takes criticism very personally. Prep some

 dough for a calzone for me, and get someone to chop some

 basil. Yeah, OK. Who are you? - I'm Rick. - You work

 here now? Looks like I do. Oh, is that new? I just

 bought it. But if you don't like it, feel free to rip

 it off me. [chuckling] I have this book proposal to discuss at

 an 8 AM meeting, so I can't really... Oh, that's OK. If

 you gotta work, you gotta work. So I was thinking about London.

 Oh? Yeah. Julie's gonna be applying to colleges soon, and a year

 abroad could give her a real boost. - So... let's do it.

 - Are you serious? Yes. I want to spend time in your

 world. I want to play cricket, I want to eat crumpets and

 I want to use the word \"ghastly\". God, Susan, you have no

 idea how excited this makes me feel. Well, my thigh's getting an

 inkling. Call a realtor first thing tomorrow and put our houses on

 the market. Not mine, OK? We can use it when we visit.

 That's what hotels are for, darling. I don't want to sell my

 house. Everybody I love is on this street. - What happened? -

 I'm feeling tired. - You weren't tired a second ago. - I'm

 not in the mood, all right? Why not? You know, I'm not

 used to being grilled about my sex drive. Well, I'm not used

 to guys bailing on me in the middle of foreplay. And by

 guys, of course, you mean Mike. What? Oh, I'm sure good old

 Mike was ready and able, 24l7. You're not actually... Oh, OK. That's

 it. - I've had it! - Susan! Really! I can't have this

 conversation one more time! I've done nothing but prove my love to

 you for the last year, and you cannot shut up about Mike!

 I don't trust the man! You don't have to trust Mike! You

 have to trust me and you don't! That's what going to England's

 about, isn't it? You're just trying to get me away from Mike.

 You know what, screw it! I'm not going! And if you ever

 bring up his name again, we're over! Got it? Over! Hi. This

 is from me and Ian. An electric juicer? Yeah, well, you know,

 you try to think of a more appropriate \"Thank you for saving

 my life\" gift. This works fine for me. Good. I should go.

 You OK? Yeah... I'm good. You sure about that? Yeah. Yeah, it's

 just... Ian and I had a little... thing. - Hi. - Hi.

 Ian, about what I said... You were right. You've never given me

 a reason to doubt you. I'm an insecure idiot. I don't deserve

 you, Susan. But if you'll please keep pretending that I do, I

 swear, I will not utter a single jealous word for the rest

 of our lives. [Victor] Gabby, what were you thinking? That stunt almost

 cost me the debate... [Victor] It's me again. OK, I get it.

 I forgot to call, and you were mad. But still... [Victor] Hi,

 I hope you got the flowers. Again, I'm so sorry for not

 calling. [Victor] Gabby, come on, what's it gonna take for you to

 forgive me? I'll do anything you want. [doorbell rings] I brought you

 some flowers. In case the other three bouquets get lonely. Thank you.

 You can go now. Don't want to take any more time out

 of your schedule. How many times do I have to say I'm

 sorry? I was thoughtless and inconsiderate. - Yes. - But what you

 did was vicious. - Trying to get your attention. - By humiliating

 me? Hey, you hurt me. If I have to strike back to

 protect myself... That's what you think this is, combat? I have been

 taken for granted, I'm not going to let it happen again. If

 I'm going to give myself to you, you better worship me! And

 I will do that. Morning and evening services. Good. You have to

 stop treating this like it's a boxing match only one of us

 can win. Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm in love with you.

 It would be nice if you'd take the gloves off and trust

 me. You're in love with me? Yeah. My campaign, that's about winning.

 This, you and me, it's about happiness. And we could both use

 a little. But maybe you need time to think about it. Look,

 no gloves. Travers conked out the moment his head hit the pillow.

 Poor little guy was beat. Well, he should be. We covered every

 inch of that zoo. Oh, check this out. You and Travers at

 the monkey house. Oh, I look squinty. Delete, delete! There's the one

 the pretzel guy took. Oh, look at the three of us. You

 have to e-mail me that one. Isn't that great? You know, he

 thought that Travers had my eyes. - Seriously? - He totally thought

 we were a family. Oh, well, if we were, we'd be one

 hell of a good-Iooking one. Yeah. Nothing better than family. Oh, wow.

 And this time I really mean it. Yeah... Me, too. [giggling] Well,

 are you gonna say anything? To be honest, I've heard better apologies.

 But I know how hard this must have been for you, and

 that makes me happy. So I accept. Thanks. That's big of you.

 And it's big of you to admit you're a chucklehead. I'll see

 you tomorrow. Did you hear that, Gilbert? He apologized. I mean, I

 know he did it just for her sake, but still. Maybe they

 have a good marriage after all. But they'll never have what we

 had. Will they, Gilbert? Not by a long shot. [Mary Alice] Passion.

 It's a force so potent we still remember it long after it's

 faded away. A drive so alluring, it can push us into the

 arms of unexpected lovers. A sensation so overwhelming, it can knock down

 walls we've built to protect our hearts. A feeling so intense, it

 resurfaces even though we tried so hard to keep it buried. Yes,

 of all emotions, passion is the one that gives us a reason

 to live... ... and an excuse to commit all sorts of crimes."}
