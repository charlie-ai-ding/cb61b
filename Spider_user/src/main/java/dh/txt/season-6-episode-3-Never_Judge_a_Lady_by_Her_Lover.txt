 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... I'm getting married. And I don't want to screw

 it up. 'Cause enough of those screw-ups, and you just end up

 alone. Gabby discovered that old flames... Yeah, that can happen. ...can leave

 embers. Do you at least know why he steals? I steal to

 hurt you. Bree's tortured marriage... I'm not your wife anymore, Orson. I'm

 your captive. Don't you feel any remorse at all over that? Guilt

 is a small price to pay for happiness. ...led her into an

 affair with Karl. What happened to the good girl? She decided guilt's

 a small price to pay for happiness. Lynette revealed a closely guarded

 secret. No one else can know about this, I'm pregnant. You are?

 Something's happened to Julie. And when a crime was committed... How does

 a fish get caught? He opens his mouth. ...a suspect emerged. There's

 a certain kind of woman you see in the suburbs. She waits

 for the school bus in her bathrobe. She stops by the post

 office with curlers in her hair. She goes to the market in

 sweatpants and a T-shirt. This woman is a housewife, and she doesn't

 bother trying to be beautiful because it's a waste of time. I

 was trying to hit Celia. Well, get better aim! Ana, help me

 clean this mess. Don't up your volume on me! Juanita, finish those

 vegetables. Don't make me count to three! Don't give me that look,

 you sawed-off little... Gabby? Oh, my God. John! Hi. Wow. What a

 surprise. I was so busy back in the kitchen, I didn't even

 know you guys were here. - How are you? - Well, I'm

 usually better when I don't have creamed spinach all over me. So,

 are you working here? Hey, nothing wrong with waiting tables. Could you

 get us some more bread? You know, maybe I can bring you

 some dessert, on the house. I'll just go ask the owner. Wait,

 that's me! Honestly? You own this place? I bought it with the

 money I got in my divorce settlement. Really? You're divorced? Yep. Almost

 a year now. Oh, my God, are these your kids? Yeah. This

 is Celia and Juanita. And this is our niece, Ana. - Hello.

 - Hi. I can see the family resemblance. She's my niece. Wow.

 It must have been a windy day when the apple fell from

 that tree. Well, it was great seeing you again. You, too. I

 still don't see any bread here. I'll be right back. Yes, there's

 a certain kind of woman you only meet in the suburbs. She

 will try to look beautiful, if she has someone to look beautiful

 for. On this street, the day begins with a cup of coffee.

 Most need it to wake up. Some can't read their morning paper

 without it. A few like to drink it on their way to

 work. Then there are those who just want something to hold in

 their hands while they discuss the neighbors. Well, Danny had me fooled.

 He seemed like a pretty nice kid. Yeah, except for the strangling.

 Sorry. Well, it's okay. I'm just happy that Julie's safe and they

 caught the guy. Susan... Bob. Go inside. Go inside. - Hey, Susan.

 - I'm confused. The last I heard, the police had Danny Bolen

 in custody. Danny was never under arrest. The police were questioning him,

 but they had no grounds to hold him. Okay, that sounds like

 his lawyer talking. Are you his lawyer? Susan, you know how much

 I love Julie. But they have no evidence against this kid, and

 I couldn't just let him sit there. If he didn't do it,

 why would he need to fake his alibi? Because he's a kid

 and he was scared. Angie, this is not a good idea. No,

 I just got to say this. Susan, please, I can't even imagine

 what you've been going through... I am begging you, as my friend

 and neighbor. Don't defend him. Susan, it's my job. Then I don't

 know how you sleep at night. Susan, wait. Come on, can we

 please just talk about this? We can go inside, just the two

 of us. No. You want to talk about this, let's do it

 out here in the open. Hey, everybody! Her son tried to kill

 my daughter! And while he's here, nobody on this street is safe.

 - What is this? - Bacon and cheese burrito. You couldn't find

 any croissants or pains au chocolat? Sweetie, we're in a motor lodge

 on the interstate. I was lucky to find a burrito. People always

 talk about the moral hazards of cheating. No one warns you about

 the food. So, you want me to book this place for tomorrow?

 I'm sorry, I have an event. Wait. You know, I think I

 do, too. How's this then? We'll go to Vegas for the weekend.

 Las Vegas? Why not? I'll lose my shirt in the casino, and

 then we'll head upstairs and you can lose yours. I can't disappear

 for a whole weekend. My husband would notice. - Say you're visiting

 family. - Karl! I'm sorry, but I don't see us having romantic

 getaways. That's the sort of thing a woman does with a man

 she's in love with. And we don't have those kinds of feelings.

 I get it. But you are a delightful diversion. And in order

 to keep things delightful, I think it's best we not put unreasonable

 demands on each other. Okay. Fine. You could've said, \"Pass the sugar.\"

 I didn't want to make a demand. So, I know you guys

 have been concerned because I've been so sick in the mornings. Well,

 I wanted to let you know why. I'm pregnant with twins. Well,

 now that the celebration is over, any questions? Yeah, aren't you going

 to be, like, the world's oldest mom? Nope, there's a woman in

 Mongolia who's got me beat. - Any other questions? - I have

 more of a statement. You two are so irresponsible. You should have

 been using birth control. You're in college. Do you know what the

 odds are now that you'll graduate? Like, zero. You, you have a

 new job. One that you'll have to quit once the baby comes.

 So, I hope you're both happy. You've just destroyed your futures for

 a few minutes of pleasure. Not to mention, it's so gross you're

 still doing it. Penny, you're excited about this, right? Yeah, getting two

 little babies to play with? If they're boys, I'm out of here.

 You have to understand, even though they've released Danny, - it doesn't

 mean he's not still a suspect. - So, what do we do?

 Well, the police are going to start digging into your background, so

 I need to know what they're going to find. - You're from

 New York, right? - Yeah. But instead of wasting your time poking

 around in the past, you just need to back up Danny's story.

 Right, just check out the liquor stores, see if anyone saw him.

 I will, but the police are going to talk to people in

 your old neighborhood, see if he's got any run-ins with the law,

 with girls. Is there anything I need to know, Danny? Nope. Not

 a thing. Okay. But I still need to establish character. So, I'll

 need to get in touch with some old teachers, friends... No, you

 don't need to do all that. Look, what are we doing here?

 I can't defend a client I know nothing about. Why can't you

 answer just a few simple questions? You want to know why? -

 Because this family has secrets! - Danny! Big dark secrets that we

 can't talk about! Not even to our lawyer. You know, who cares

 if it makes me look guilty, even if I'm not? Knock it

 off! This conversation was privileged, right? So, I don't know if you

 heard, but this morning the police released Danny Bolen. I heard. You

 must be worried sick. I am. Clearly he's unstable. Who knows what

 he might do next. So, what are we going to do about

 it? You ever hear about that old man on Maple Drive? People

 found out he used to be an accountant for the Nazis and

 they threw garbage all over his yard. That's right. And he moved.

 But then it was bought by some ex-hippie who painted the house

 pink so it was a Pyrrhic victory at best. Well, look, I'm

 just bringing this up because I don't want people on this street

 thinking that they're safe when they're not. Susan, could you give me

 a hand for a sec? Honey, what are you doing? Mona Clark's

 got a big mouth. If you get her worked up, she's going

 to talk about Danny to everybody in the neighborhood. So? So, we

 don't want an angry mob showing up at the Bolens' house. Especially

 if we aren't even sure Danny's the one that attacked Julie. He

 lied about his alibi. Why would he do that if he was

 innocent? Well... That's a good point. And how can I live with

 myself if someone else's daughter gets attacked and I have said nothing?

 Okay. Okay, I get it. It's just this whole thing will be

 a lot easier if the police just had some proof. Well, maybe

 we should get them some. John. Hey. I wanted to talk to

 you about something. I thought I should do it in person out

 of respect. Uh-huh. Your niece came to my restaurant and she asked

 me for a hostessing job. And I think she'd be great. You

 know, but given our history, I wanted to make sure you're okay

 with it. Because I wouldn't do it if it would make you

 feel uncomfortable. I mean, that's the last thing I'd want. Like I

 said, given our history. Yeah. Why don't you stop saying \"given our

 history\" and just say \"I banged your wife\"? You know, it's not

 that I haven't forgiven you. It's just that every time I see

 you, I want to put my fist in your face. Now, did

 you park in the building? Because we validate. You know what? I

 think this was a bad idea. Besides, Gabby probably wouldn't have liked

 it anyway. - What? - Come on. I mean, her niece working

 for me? I think she would've freaked out. You know, given our

 history. John? Hold on a second. Ana working for John? Are you

 nuts? You're the one who's been saying she should get a job.

 Yeah, at the mall hocking soft pretzels, not working for... Your ex-lover?

 Well, yeah. How can you not think it's awkward? Because that was

 years ago. We're past all that, right? Of course we are. It's

 just... The whole thing makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry, I'm going to

 have to say no. I knew it. You're jealous. Jealous? Of who?

 Your beautiful niece working for your ex-lover. - What? - You still

 have the hots for him. Don't deny it. I saw you. \"Really

 You're divorced?\" Okay, first of all, you just reminded me why I

 hate mimes. Secondly, is that why you're letting Ana work for John?

 - You were testing me? - Yeah. And you failed. Carlos, you

 are way out of line. Deny it all you want, but I

 know what I saw. You wanted to look pretty for your ex-lover.

 You know, he was also my ex-gardener! Can't you call him that?

 It's so long since I've seen you two together. I was starting

 to wonder if you'd split up. - No, we're still married. -

 Just try getting away from this one! Arm. Bree, I know you're

 unhappy, but we haven't been out in months. Could you at least

 make an effort for one night? You're absolutely right. Why don't you

 get me one of those crab puffs and then we'll mingle? -

 Sweetheart, this is just what I'm... - Crab puff! Karl. - Bree?

 - What are you doing here? - What do you mean? -

 Are you following me? No. I'm a member of the club. I

 had no idea that this was the event that you were talking

 about. So, you expect me to believe that you showed up at

 a dinner dance alone? - No, actually... - Karl, I know you

 have feelings for me, but I would hate to see them turn

 into some kind of obsession. Hey, hon. Find our table? And you

 were saying? So, Karl, aren't you going to introduce me? This is

 Candace. She's an old friend. Don't you mean that you're her old

 friend? Candace, why don't we go find our table? Bree, if we

 don't run into you again, good. He doesn't mean to be brusque.

 He's just a little eager to rush through dinner so we can

 get to the motor lodge. Motor lodge? He wanted to go earlier,

 but I said no. Lobster first, then dessert. Candace, why don't we

 start putting that lobster in your mouth right now? Goodbye, Bree. Candace?

 - Dr. Hodge! - Jeez... You two know each other? Yes, Candace

 was a dental patient of mine. I still think of you every

 time I put in my night guard. Listen, there's room at our

 table. Would you care to join us? No! I mean, we're going

 to be leaving soon. You know, that motor lodge can wait. That

 way Orson and Candace can catch up. And you and I can

 have a little talk, too. Sure. It sounds like fun. Karl and

 I'll just go get a couple apple martinis and we'll come right

 back. - Lovely girl, isn't she? - Hmm. I'll tell you a

 secret, though. Her two front teeth? Veneers. I'm guessing those aren't her

 only side by side enhancements. She's actually very sweet. Shame to see

 her mixed up with a dog like Karl. You have to pity

 any woman who makes that mistake. Yes, you do. - Susan? -

 No! Get in! Get in, get in, get in! Okay. - What

 are you doing? - Stay low! Okay, let's try that again. What

 are you doing? Surveillance. I'm going to nail that Danny Bolen kid.

 - I thought the police were... - The police are useless. So

 I'm keeping a log of all of his comings and goings. If

 he leaves and another girl gets attacked, he won't be able to

 lie and say he was home. Well, I've got a few minutes

 to kill. Oh, by the way, I was going to call you.

 You haven't told Gabby I'm pregnant, have you? No. Why? Well, I

 haven't had a chance to tell Carlos yet. And I really think

 he should hear it from me... Get down! Oh! - You think

 I'm nuts, don't you? - No, I think you're a mother. Thank

 you. Although, speaking as a fellow mother, do you remember what happened

 to Porter? Everyone in town was so sure he set that fire

 and killed those people. People can be sure, and they can be

 wrong. I'm not wrong. Okay. - What are you doing? - Following

 him. Buckle up. No, I can't! I have to put a meatloaf

 in the oven! Wait! Wait! I forgot my... So, Candace, what do

 you do for a living? I'm a dancer. Oh. What kind? Jazz?

 Ballet? Lap? Actually, Candace was a Rockette. Oh. It must have been

 exhausting spending so much time with your legs in the air. I

 love this song. Bree, would you care to dance? Sorry, my shoes

 are killing me. Ask Candace. She's the pro. I'd love to. Have

 fun, you two! You loathsome pig. You're supposed to be cheating with

 me, not on me. I asked if you were free, you weren't,

 I called Candace. What's the problem? Well, it's just that she's so

 cheap. She's beneath you. Not yet, but she will be. Bravo! Well

 done! If her dress were any lower, it would be a belt.

 Gosh, Bree, could this be jealousy I'm hearing? I'm not jealous. I'm

 appalled. And as long as we're together, I will not have you

 running around with other women. But we're not together. I'm just a

 diversion, remember? A little fling to spice up an afternoon. And if

 that's all I am to you, fine. But you don't get to

 say what I can do when the afternoon's over. Are you going

 to take her to our motor lodge tonight? Just try and stop

 me. Excuse me, someone over at that table was looking for you.

 What the hell happened here? Orson tripped. Really, sweetheart, you need to

 be more careful. I'm so sorry. The floor was slippery. - Are

 you all right? - I think I broke my nose. I should

 go to the emergency room. Oh, dear. And you had such lovely

 plans for the evening. Hey, Janice, is Carlos done with his meeting

 yet? I really need to talk to him. - Got a sec?

 - Never mind. Something wrong? How would you like a parking space

 closer to the entrance? I'd love it. You closed the door for

 that? No, I closed the door to ask if you would like

 to be my new senior VP. Seriously? Oh! God, Carlos, I am

 so flattered. - And I would love to say yes, it's just...

 - I know. More responsibility, more hours away from home. But you

 get a company car and an expense account. Which is very generous,

 but I still can't accept because... And a 50% salary bump. Because

 it doesn't have a 50% salary bump. But now that it does,

 I'm in. When do I start? Tonight. We're having dinner with a

 big potential client. He is bringing his wife, so please bring Tom.

 Sure. Wait, weren't you going to give this promotion to Judy? I

 was. But between you and me, I found out she's pregnant. Overheard

 her on the phone, saw what was coming, doctor's visits, sick days,

 maternity leave... Yeah, that can be annoying. But isn't denying a woman

 a promotion because she's pregnant a tiny bit illegal? Only if she

 finds out. And I mean, who's going to tell her? My new

 senior VP? Hell no. She's too busy thinking about that big bump

 she's got coming. Yes? I've been thinking about last night, and you,

 Karl, Candy. And it finally hit me what was really going on.

 - What are you talking about? - The oil on the dance

 floor. That was no accident. You put it there. You wanted Candy

 to fall. - That's ridiculous. - Admit it. You were jealous of

 that girl from the moment Karl walked in with her. Orson, you're

 not making any sense. Why would I be jealous of Karl's date?

 Because she was dancing with me, of course. I suppose I should

 be mad at you for nearly breaking my neck, - but I'm

 too relieved. - Relieved? Yes, if watching me dance with a pretty

 girl can make you that crazy, then you obviously still care for

 me. There's still hope for us. Orson, you are reading way too

 much into one impulsive act. Oh, argue all you like. A woman

 doesn't pull a stunt like that over a man she's not in

 love with. Karl, hi, it's Bree. I'm thinking maybe I'm ready for

 that weekend in Las Vegas. Hi, Mrs. Bolen, I'm a friend of

 Danny's from school. Is he in? - You got a name? -

 Sorry. Eddie. Danny! There's an Eddie here. It's a nice house. You

 know what happened here, right? Huh? Oh, yeah. What are you going

 to do? - Hey, what's up? - Hey, my brakes are shot.

 Is there any chance you could take a look at them? Nah,

 I don't feel like it, Eddie. Come on. You've been moping around

 the house all day. Go! Help your buddy. I'm glad one of

 us has a friend. I was at the supermarket earlier, everybody was

 looking at me like I had their grandmother in my trunk. Yeah,

 and while you were out, three hate calls in one hour. I

 don't know. I'm starting to think it's time to get out of

 the Bolen business. No. We cannot change our names and run every

 time there's a little trouble. This is more than a little trouble,

 babe. I don't care. We're not putting Danny through all that again.

 Maybe this hasn't worked out the way we'd hoped. But until I

 say otherwise, we are Nick and Angie Bolen. Hey, can you go

 into the basement and get me a work light? - Yeah. -

 Thanks. Got a second? Sure. I'm really sorry about what happened to

 Julie. Thanks. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

 I didn't hurt her, Mrs. Delfino. But you did fight with her.

 I mean, Mrs. McCluskey saw you. What were you fighting with her

 about? I'm sorry, that lawyer told me that I shouldn't talk to

 anybody about this stuff. I know that Julie thought she was pregnant.

 - What? - You didn't think I knew that, right? - Is

 that what you fought about? - Wait, no... - Is that why

 you attacked my daughter? - No, I didn't even know that. -

 You're lying! - No, I'm not. - You're lying! - Please, just

 leave me alone. Hey! What are you doing? I know that you

 did it! I can see it in your eyes! - Mom! Dad!

 Help me! - Just admit that you did it! - Admit it!

 Admit it to me! - Mrs. Delfino, please! - Hey! Get the

 hell away from him! - Are you going to attack me? -

 Hey! - What the hell is wrong with you? He did it!

 You know that he... Ma! Careful! You come near him again, I

 swear I will kill you! You can't protect him forever. People know

 what he is now. And he is going to be punished. Come

 on. Come on. Hey! What the hell happened to my car? Hi,

 Uncle Carlos. Your clients are here. I put them at our best

 table. Thank you, sweetie. - Lynette... - Yeah? Are you sure about

 this? About being senior VP with a 50% salary bump? Yeah. But

 did you hear the way he described the job in the car?

 I mean, it sounds like a killer schedule. I can handle it.

 And you get to stay in school. Remember your big dream, our

 future? Of course. But how are we going to keep it a

 secret? Carlos is going to find out about this thing eventually. By

 then, I will have proved I can do the job, pregnant or

 not. - Please. - Okay, I'm in. But you got to prove

 it fast. Remember the last time you were pregnant with twins, every

 part of you swelled up. It was like sleeping next to a

 body they dragged out of a river. - You said I was

 beautiful. - I had to. You were twice my size. This is

 a 2004 Barolo from my vineyard in Piedmont. Your vineyard? Yeah, that's

 why I insisted on this restaurant. They carry my label. I love

 business, but wine is my passion. Oh, none for me tonight. Why

 not? Well, I want to keep my head clear for business. No.

 No business talk. Tonight is about getting to know each other over

 good food and fine wine. Yeah, Lynette. His wine. So, drink up.

 Well, I guess a little wouldn't hurt. There, very nice. So, Vic,

 what do you suggest to go with your wine? Let me see...

 Oh, the carpaccio sounds like a nice starter. Wow, Lynette. You liked

 it, huh? - It was delicious. - Lucky for you it's a

 big vineyard. Thank you. Oh, look! One of the Pointer Sisters! Sorry.

 It was just a nun. Excuse me, I'll be right back. -

 Gabby, what the hell? - I know. I'm sorry I'm late. I

 mean your clothes. Didn't I see that shirt in the hamper this

 morning? I gave it a sniff, it has another day in it.

 Gabby, this is an important business dinner. Yeah, but it's also John

 Rowland's restaurant. If I made myself pretty, you might think I was

 doing it just for him. God help me. Is that what this

 is about? Well, I didn't want to run the risk of failing

 another test. Okay, Gabby, go change. You made your point. Not quite.

 For the past 11 years, I have stood beside you when you

 were poor and blind and knocked me up twice. At this point

 in our marriage, if you still feel the need to test me,

 then you're the one who has failed. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank

 you. And for the record, I only took my clip off and

 shook out my hair because I ran into somebody I knew. I

 would've done it if it was Lynette Scavo. Okay? Okay. So, do

 you think you can go home and... Don't worry. I have clothes

 and makeup in the car. Good. Because that shirt did not have

 another day in it. Hello? Who is this? What is your name?

 You got a big mouth for a guy with no name. No,

 no, no, you listen to me! You come anywhere near my family,

 I will personally bash your brains in. Assuming you have any! -

 You okay? - I'm fine. Just another moron with some empty threats.

 And what if they're not empty? Do you know where your father

 and I keep the gun? Ma... No, look, you're old enough to

 know this stuff. Just in case someone should try to come in

 here and hurt you... I can take care of myself. Well, just

 in case you can't take care of yourself, there's a loaded .38

 Smith & Wesson in a box in the second drawer of my

 dresser. You got that? - What are you smiling at? - It's

 just... It's not your typical mother-son conversation. You know I've always felt

 bad about the way we've had to raise you. Being on the

 run and all. If it weren't for me, you could have had

 a normal childhood. Ma, you don't ever have to apologize to me.

 I'm glad you're not like other moms. Thanks, baby. I just want

 to be a good one. Remember, aim for the head, not the

 legs. So, Patti comes downstairs, and sitting under the Christmas tree is

 the cutest golden retriever puppy you ever saw. It was the best

 present I ever got. Aw. - Do you like dogs, Lynette? -

 I love them! But Penny is allergic, so we got fish. Fish

 suck. Swim, die, flush, new one. Swim, die, flush, new one. You

 know what dog I'd really like, is the Rammerwiener. - Weimaraner. -

 A Weimandhammer. - Weimaraner. - Rammerjammer. Lynette, make him stop. Gabby, you

 know what? I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid it's

 going to come out wrong. Your boobs look great in that dress.

 Wow. Tom, how could that possibly come out wrong? - You'd be

 surprised. - Well, you'll have to excuse Tom. He's a bit of

 a lightweight, and your wine is so delicious he couldn't resist. But

 look at you. You've had at least a bottle and you would

 never know. - You might as well finish this off. - No,

 no, no! If she has one more glass, I'm going to puke.

 I just talked to Bob. - Why would you do that? -

 He asked me to stop by. Because he wanted to tell me

 that the police have evidence that clears Danny Bolen. What? They've got

 a shot from a security camera at Fairview Liquors that puts him

 there at the time Julie was attacked. - How would they know

 that? - There's a time stamp. They don't know the exact time

 of the attack. The camera shows him sitting in the parking lot

 drinking beer for over an hour. He couldn't have done it. I

 can't believe this. That means that Julie's attacker is still out there.

 And I've been going up and down the street telling everybody that

 Danny Bolen did it. Your daughter was hurt. You wanted somebody to

 blame. People get that. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Well, I'm sure

 the Bolens will understand. No, not just to them, to you. What

 are you talking about? Well, you woke up the morning after your

 wedding and found yourself married to a mad woman. I've been just

 totally obsessed with finding Julie's attacker. And... I said \"for better or

 worse.\" So, we start with the worse. Wow, I'm glad this night's

 over. I'm exhausted. Yeah, me, too. - You coming to bed? -

 I'll be up in a sec. I'm going to turn off some

 lights. On this street, the day begins with a cup of coffee.

 Some drink it while recalling a lover they once cared for. Some

 pour it thinking of the boss they must lie to. Others sip

 it contemplating a man they might be in love with. But for

 one woman on this particular morning, that cup of coffee has to

 wait. Because she discovers a neighbor in trouble. She goes to help

 not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's

 the only way she can think of to ask for forgiveness. And
