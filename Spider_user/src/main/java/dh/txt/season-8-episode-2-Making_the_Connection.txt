 ":"Previously

 on... Ladies. Renee was charmed by the new neighbor. Dibs. Trying to

 protect Gaby, Carlos committed murder. We are never gonna be able to

 tell anybody about this. Are you gonna be able to live with

 that? And the women swore to keep the secret. But then Bree

 received a warning. When I was alive, Bree Van De Kamp was

 one of my closest friends. Maybe that's because we had so much

 in common. Like Bree, I also received a menacing letter... One that

 threatened to shatter the perfect life I had worked so hard to

 create. You see, I had once committed a desperate act of my

 own. And despite my best efforts to conceal it, someone found out

 and was determined to expose me. I thought about telling my friends.

 But I decided not to burden them. I had hoped that with

 one final act, I could consign my deeds to history. But I

 had forgotten that history... has a way of repeating itself. Something interesting?

 No. No, just a... letter... from a friend who I haven't, uh,

 heard from in a while. You okay? I'm fine. I'm just annoyed

 because the, uh, postman left me Gaby's water bill again. You go

 in. I'll just put it back in the box. All right. Oh,

 Karen. You scared me. What are you doing out so late? What

 am I, a cat? I'm allowed to be out past 10:00. I'm

 sorry. Have you seen anyone near my mailbox? What's the problem? I

 just... got a letter. An obscene letter. That's all? You oughta be

 happy that someone still finds you obscene. Last week, I got called

 \"Sir\" three times. Karen! This is serious. I need to find out

 who put this letter in my mailbox. Wow, you're really shaken up.

 Yes, I am. This is very upsetting, and I don't know what

 I'm going to do. It's just a note, Bree. Let it go.

 Yes, Bree Van De Kamp and I had so much in common.

 We shared similar lives. And now Bree found herself praying that we

 wouldn't share a similar fate. In the divided world of the suburbs,

 everyone is looking for a way to connect. They fend off loneliness

 with casual conversation. They share old treasures with a young friend. They

 help a neighbor make a difficult move. But for Carlos and Gaby

 Solis, the only connection that mattered was the romantic one. And when

 it came to maintaining it, Gaby was willing to pull out all

 the stops. What are we celebrating? A new record. It's been 38

 days since we last had sex, and that streak is ending tonight.

 Seriously, it's been that long? 38 days. That's like three years in

 hoo-hah time. Sweetie, I would love to, but I have way too

 much work to do. Unh-unh. No, no. No excuses. I changed the

 sheets, shaved my legs, and dumped the kids at McCluskey's, so drop

 your pants, cowboy, and saddle up. Yes, ma'am. Oh! Don't feel bad.

 It happens to lots of men. Not to me. Not to us.

 Well, it has been 38 days. Maybe the poor little guy forgot

 what to do. Not helping. Oh. Listen, you've been under a lot

 of stress lately. So relax. How about I give you a nice

 massage, we finish the champagne, and later we try again? Gaby, thanks,

 but it's not gonna work, okay? Like Carlos, Susan Delfino was also

 feeling disconnected. Her guilt made the world a strange and scary place...

 where she could be exposed at any moment. Hey! Hold it right

 there! I know what you did. What? Yeah, and you're not getting

 away with it. You thought you could walk out with a case

 of soda and no one would notice? Oh. Uh... I-I forgot those

 were down there. Yeah. Right. I've never heard that one before. Ma'am,

 I'm gonna ask you to step away from the cart and keep

 your hands where I can see 'em. Everything okay here? If you

 consider larceny okay. Mrs. Delfino, on behalf of Fairview market, I'd like

 to apologize for Kevin. Seems we're all paying the price for his

 rejection from the police academy. Oh, well, excuse me for not wanting

 to live in a world where people can commit crimes without suffering

 the consequences. You are a criminal. I've known Mrs. Delfino for years.

 She pays for the grapes she eats in the produce section. She

 would never do anything bad. Sure, I would. What? You don't know

 me at all. I'm a very bad person. I did a horrible

 thing. I deserve to be punished. Let me cuff her. I have

 cuffs. I brought 'em from home. No one's getting cuffed. Just... pay

 for the soda next time you come in. No, no, no. No,

 you need to march me inside - and make me pay now.

 - Mrs. Delfino... I'm serious. Make an example of me to deter

 other criminals. - Fine. Take her in. - Copy that. Yep. Did

 the crime. Doing the time. Dead man walking. So what's the damage?

 An arm and a leg? Just an arm? Not even a finger.

 It's a cracked fitting. I swapped it out. It's no charge. Really?

 The first guy I called said I had to re-pipe the whole

 house. Oh, it's a scam. These pipes are top-of-the-line copper. The guy

 that put 'em in did a great job. How do you know?

 It was me. You just saved me 10 grand. No wonder people

 say such good things about you. Well... What are neighbors for? Need

 anything else, just holler. Actually, there is one thing. I'm a real

 estate developer, about to break ground on a new project, and, uh,

 I'm looking for some help... local guys that I can trust. You

 interested? Hey, Mike. Got a minute? Um... Hey, Renee. We're friends, right?

 Well... Oh, come on. You fixed my toilet for free. Um, that

 wasn't free. I sent you a bill. You just haven't paid it.

 Ahh. Anyway, look, here's the deal. Uh, Ben likes me. He just

 doesn't know it yet. Now I need to find that thing that

 we connect on. You've been on the inside. What can you tell

 me about him? Well, he's got copper pipes. Something personal. I saw

 a box of cheerios... and a coffeemaker. He must like coffee. Unless

 it's for guests. Oh, my god. I got more out of the

 cable guy, and he's deaf. Does he have any photos? Artwork? Think,

 Delfino, think! Okay. Okay. Um... There was this plaque from the mayor...

 Something about his work with the elderly. Really? He likes the elderly?

 Well, I like the elderly. Since when? Oh. Old people are adorable.

 I love their little raisin faces and those tennis balls they put

 on their walkers. Thanks for the tip... Friend. Mom! Hey, how was

 your day? Awesome. Dad's hotel is so cool. We went swimming in

 the pool and played marco polo and cannonballed off the diving board.

 Why don't we have a pool? And then we got hamburgers and

 french fries and super-sized cherry cola slushies. Ah. Sugar and caffeine. I

 guess you figured they were too young for meth? It's just a

 slushie. On a school night. She's gonna be up till 2:00 A.M.

 Just 'cause you couldn't say \"No.\" You're blowing this out of proportion.

 Who wants to play mega monopoly? It's just like regular monopoly but

 with more stuff. You just keep playing and playing and playing and

 playing and playing... Yeah. Way out of proportion. Look, now that we're

 really separated, I refuse to be the bad guy all the time.

 You have got to learn to say \"No.\" I say it. Tonight

 when we walked past the pet shop, they wanted a spider monkey.

 I said \"No.\" I'm serious. Things are different now. I'm not gonna

 let this be the house of pain while you're living it up

 at the MTV beach house. You're right. Things are different now. For

 instance, I used to have to stand here and listen to this.

 But now I'm thinking... no. Hey, look at that. I'm getting pretty

 good at this \"No\" thing. It's bad enough when we weren't even

 trying to have sex, but to try and fail? Well, do you

 think it might have something to do with the stress Carlos is

 under? We're all under stress. You know what's stressful? Is not having

 sex for 39 1/2 days. You're sounding a little callous. I don't

 mean to. It's just, sex is important to us. Even in our

 toughest times, it's what always held us together. If we don't have

 that, I'm worried what will happen to us. I get that. So...

 come on, girls. How can I spice things up in the bedroom?

 Is this actually happening? Gabrielle Solis is asking us for sex tips?

 I know! It's the apocalypse. Well, if you don't mind harsh lighting

 and blatant misogyny, you can always watch a porno. Watched one. Filmed

 one. Next. This may shock you, but sometimes Mike and I like

 doing it in public. Huh. Those of us who wandered by Santa's

 workshop at the Christmas carnival... Not that shocked. You could try role-playing.

 Once, I dressed up in a french maid's costume, and Orson pretended

 to be a stubborn stain, and why is everybody looking at me?

 Seriously, guys, I need some new moves. Well, there's this one mom

 at school... and I promised I wouldn't use her name... Betty Cunningham...

 who hired a stripper to teach her how to give her husband

 a lap dance. Well, I don't know what a stripper could teach

 me, but it's worth a shot. You really think that's gonna work?

 Why wouldn't it? Because... I get where Carlos is coming from. This

 kind of guilt can really mess with your head. Something you wanna

 talk about? Okay, the other day, I accidentally took a case of

 soda from the supermarket, and the security guard started yelling at me.

 And at first, I was like, \"No,\" but then I was like

 \"Yes, I deserve it.\" \"I deserve to be punished.\" It felt right

 to be publicly humiliated like that, and why is everybody looking at

 me? 'Cause there's a bucket of crazy where your head used to

 be. So now I'm crazy. I thought you said I could talk

 to you about this stuff. You can, and we appreciate what you're

 grappling with, but you cannot go around attracting attention like that. It's

 not safe. Exactly. So knock it off and go get me some

 more coffee! What? She likes to be yelled at. Hey, you. Uh,

 I thought you were, uh, at work. I pronounce the city of

 Fairview safe enough to have lunch with my girl. Oh, that would

 be lovely, but I have something I need to do. Shoot. Oh,

 yeah? Like what? What? Unless it's a... it's a big secret. Is

 it a big secret? Chuck. I'm sorry. You're right. I... You don't

 owe me any explanations. I just... I just need to know that

 we're okay. Chuck... My feelings for you have not changed, just my

 schedule for the day. Mwah. Well, that's good, because suspicion can be

 a great trait in police work, but it's horrible in a relationship.

 Just ask my ex. I never wanna be that guy again. Hello

 there, Karen. \"Karen\"? What happened to \"Liver spot\" or \"6 feet under\"

 or one of your other cute nicknames? No, no, I can't come

 in! I'm just dropping off another home-cooked meal! What meal? What the

 hell are you yelling for? Just lift the napkin. 50 bucks. What's

 the catch? Don't look now, but do you see Ben over there?

 Mm. Subtle. Anyway, he has a soft spot for old people, and

 as far as he knows, so do I. No, no, your crinkled

 little smile is thanks enough for me. Are you petting me? Just

 say nice things about me to Ben. Tell him I bring you

 meals, that kind of stuff. Well, it's a pretty big favor for

 50 bucks. Considering I don't like you, I'll do it for $100.

 Fine. Tomorrow I'll bring you a c-note and a jell-o mold. Deal?

 Oh, Renee. Bless your heart. You're so good to me. No, you're

 the one who enriches my life. The joy I get... Hands off.

 He's gone. Oh, my god. You think I sent this? You have

 any idea how this makes me feel? Forgive me. I didn't think

 it was possible to damage the self-esteem of a murderer. A confessed

 murderer. And this-this is the only way you can see me? Paul!

 Paul. Please. I'm sorry. I've just been so panicked since I got

 it. It has the exact same wording as the letter Mary Alice

 received. Yes. That's very weird. But why are you so worked up

 about it? I believe Mary Alice got a little worked up when

 she got hers. But she was hiding something. You aren't. Right? Of

 course not. It's obviously just a cruel prank, but I still wanna

 know who's responsible. It had to be someone who knew about the

 original note. Well, let's see. Obviously there's Martha Huber. Obviously she didn't

 send it. Then there's you, Susan, Lynette, Gaby. I assume you've already

 asked them. Uh, actually, I-I haven't mentioned it to the girls yet.

 I-I still haven't figured out exactly what it is. Well, whatever it

 is, don't keep it to yourself. If Mary Alice had shared her

 note with you girls... things might have turned out... a whole different

 way. You know it's recycling day. So? So it looks like you're

 about to put kitchen garbage in your recycling bin. Oh. I hope

 I don't get punished. Oh, here I am, dropping a turkey carcass

 in with the recycling. And here I am, not giving a crap.

 Uh-oh. You got me. Can I bum one? My old lady made

 me quit. 17... 18... 19... Thank god. Those were from last week.

 Hello. Uh, Ben, isn't it? Yes. Uh, listen, uh, I was just

 talking to Mrs. McCluskey, and I gotta say, I really misjudged you.

 - Oh? - Yeah. She was telling me all the ways you've

 helped her. Well, I like to think I'm doing god's work, you

 know, until he takes her in her sleep or what have you.

 Yeah, I don't know if you knew this, but I'm quite involved

 with seniors myself. Get out! Look at us, having things in common.

 Yeah. So is there something else I can help you with? Actually,

 yes. Are you free tonight? Hey, buddy. What are you thinking for

 dinner tonight? Mexican? Chinese? Actually, there's a party at Rich Cohen's I

 was hoping to go to. Yeah? Don't hope too hard. Why not?

 Remember when Rich turned 13? It was the only bar mitzvah ever

 shut down by the police. I don't trust his parents. Well, if

 you makes you feel better, they're out of town. Ooh, an unsupervised

 party? Even better. We're just gonna be eating pizza and watching movies

 and stuff, and Rich's older brother will be there. Perfect. Someone to

 buy the beer. So you're saying \"No\"? Again? Uh... I'm not saying

 no. I'm saying ask your dad. Hey! I'm just dropping off a

 check. Hang on a sec. Parker has something he wants to ask

 you. Parker. Can I go to a party at Rich Cohen's house

 tonight? What did your mom say? His mom said he should ask

 his dad. Oh. Well... H-his parents are gonna be there, right? Nope.

 No parents. And... Rich Cohen... didn't something happen at his bar mitzvah?

 Lots of things happened... drinking, pot smoking, the whittaker girl got pregnant.

 It sounds like you already made up your mind here. No, no,

 no. I have not made up my mind. It is entirely up

 to you. You hear that, dad? Entirely up to you. Well... I-it

 seems like your mom doesn't think this is a good idea... I

 didn't say that. I don't not think it's a good idea. Oh,

 so you do do think it's a good idea. I don't not

 think it's not... not... a good idea. Okay, I'm confused. Well, if

 your mom's not saying \"No,\" I'm not saying \"No\" either. Oh! Well,

 if your dad's not saying \"No,\" I'm sure as hell not going

 to say \"No.\" So is that a \"Yes\"? Well... it's not a

 \"No.\" Sweet. Are you sure this thing is safe? My son plays

 fireman on mine all the time. Do you wanna see a picture?

 Let's not make this sadder than it is. All right, so my

 husband's having a little problem In the bedroom. With his wiener? Yes,

 with his... wiener. Well, you can relax, because I'm like a doctor,

 and I see this problem all the time with older women. \"Older\"?

 Excuse me. I don't think our ages are that far apart. When

 were you born? 1992. Me, too. All right, enough chitchat. Give me

 a taste of what I'm gonna learn here. Okay. I'd do ya.

 Let me try. That was kind of advanced. I was thinking maybe

 we could start with something simple, Like grinding on a chair. Okay,

 will you stop treating me like a grandma? I do yoga and

 zumba and kickboxing. I'm in excellent shape. Okay. Not bad. Okay, now

 ass up, legs out, and remember, slow is sexy. Oh, my god.

 Okay. Uh... A little harder than it looks. No worries. You'll pick

 it up in no time. Six months tops. What?! I can't wait

 that long. I need your moves, your body... My ass, but basically

 I need to be you by tonight. Hey, what are you doing

 tonight? I'm headlining at Double D's. If I triple your pay, would

 you mind being the opening act here? Ben, I don't know how

 the food is, but I already love this restaurant. We are the

 youngest people here. Oh, this isn't a restaurant. This is the senior

 center. Welcome to the Ben Faulkner function room. We're not eating here,

 are we? No, no, we're serving. We can eat afterwards if there

 are, you know, leftovers. Oh, fun. Uh, but I'm... I'm a little

 underdressed. There you go. There. Now you're perfect. Gaby, F.Y.I., guys who

 used to be blind don't enjoy reliving it. Relax. You're gonna love

 this. Now just sit back and get ready for takeoff. Yeah. Wow.

 You've been working out. I have... but that's not my ass. It's

 a professional's. Meet Dakota. What the hell? What is this? A gift

 from your wife. I work at Double D's, out by the interstate.

 Not the one by the airport that had the hepatitis scare. You

 hired a stripper. Only as a warm-up act. Then later on, she'll

 clear out, and it's just you and me for the main event.

 Nope. Not doing this. Hang on. Idea. Sit down. Oh! Okay. What

 are you doing? I don't... Oh, my god. He's right. Your body...

 it's like a dolphin. Give it a little spank. Nothing will fix

 his problem quicker than a little girl-on-girl action. My \"problem.\" You told

 her. Okay, quick. Make out with me. Do you have any idea

 how embarrassing this is for me? Thank you, doctor. You can go

 now. How could you do that to me? Try to get our

 sex life back on track? Carlos, even at our worst, this is

 the one thing that's always worked for us. I just want us

 to get back to normal. We're never going back to normal! Don't

 you understand that?! What I did... you can't wish it away. It

 is with me all the time, whether I'm awake or asleep... or

 trying to make love to you. I'm sorry. I just wish there

 was something I could do. There's not. What's that? I don't know.

 Is it good? Let me clue you in on something. Food is

 usually either good or free. How come you're dressed so fancy? Because

 I'm on a date with that hot Aussie over there. He just

 failed to mention what the date was. Ben brought you to sling

 food dressed like that? Honey, I think he's messing with you. I

 hope you had a good laugh. Be thankful I shoved that on

 your head. There was another option. Renee, stop. Why? So you can

 mock me some more? I wasn't mocking you. Okay, but I mean,

 you did kinda deserve it... I mean, your whole \"I heart old

 people\" thing. I was trying to find something we had in common,

 and now I know we have nothing in common. You're a good

 person who does things like this, and... I'm me. You're not a

 good person? No, Ben, I'm not. Because truthfully, doing charity makes me

 nauseous. Yeah, me, too. What? Makes me uncomfortable, too, but I know

 why that is. Do you? I don't want to talk about this.

 Why? You afraid of saying something truthful? When my mom... died, I

 was bounced around from relative to relative, most of them dirt-poor. We

 were on the receiving end of a lot of charity. I spent

 plenty of time in places like this. And I hated it. They

 hand you something... a, uh, a dented can of food or an

 ugly shirt. And someone tells you, \"Say 'thank you' to the nice

 lady.\" And you do, but secretly, you wanna scream, \"I hate you.\"

 I know what it's like to claw your way out of something.

 Look at us... having things in common. It's about time. Is there

 a problem, officer? Yeah. You're parked in a fire zone. Oh! Darn

 the luck, I am. Well, sounds like somebody's gonna be slapped with

 a pretty steep fine. Yeah, I should write you a ticket. But

 if you promise not to do it again, I'll let you off

 with a warning. What? Why would you do that? - 'Cause I'm

 a new dad. - Oh, jeez. Abigail Dorothy Brovka, 8 pounds, 6

 ounces. I'm just so happy, filled with love. Anything short of a

 triple murder, and I'm pretty much looking the other way. No, no.

 No, don't look the other way. No, look this way. Laws have

 been broken. There must be consequences. I just wanna get home to

 my baby. I mean, look at her, all wrapped up like the

 tastiest little burrito in Fairview. - Oh, look at that. - Yeah.

 Ah, well... That was not cool. Now fortunately for you, I always

 carry a backup. Are you kidding me? What do I have to

 do to get arrested here? Lady, people like you used to drive

 me nuts. But nothing can faze me now that this sweet little

 girl's come into my life. Well, that sweet little girl... she's got

 dumbo ears. Ma'am, you can turn around and put your hands behind

 your back. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say

 can and will be used against you in a court of law.

 Hey, Mike. Um, I, uh, I've got a bit of a problem.

 Maybe you can help me out with it. I can try. What's

 the problem? You. How am I supposed to hire you when I

 can't get you bonded? Who knew? Mike Delfino, suburban dad, guy who

 keeps the neatest lawn on the block, Ex con? Yep. And you

 were gonna mention this when? Look, I'm sorry. It's not something I

 tend to lead with when I meet somebody. 'cause you're not that

 guy anymore. That's right. A bad cop tried to rape your girlfriend,

 and you fought him to protect her. Tell me why you wouldn't

 wanna be that guy anymore. It was a long time ago. I

 was a kid, and I've learned life's a lot more complicated than

 I thought. Nah. Nah. Life is brutally simple. Life is getting what

 you want and protecting who you love... and everything else is weakness.

 A guy like you... guy like you knows it. Ben, if this

 is all just to tell me you can't use me, I understand.

 No, no, no, no, I didn't say that. I said I couldn't

 bond you. I can definitely use you. I hope you've cooled off

 a bit. Yeah. Well, uh, spending a few hours in a cell

 with a drunk transvestite will do that to you. Your baby's cute,

 by the way. I swear she'll grow into those ears. Thanks. The

 guy you called to pick you up is here. Carlos, thanks for

 coming. I couldn't call Mike, and, uh, I didn't wanna upset the

 girls, so... You okay? They told me you assaulted a motorcycle cop.

 Actually, it was just a motorcycle. That doesn't sound like you. I've

 been... in this weird place lately. I keep doing things, hoping to

 get caught. Does it help? For five minutes. And then I just

 feel guilty again. I just don't know how to pull myself out

 of this. I get it. Gaby keeps pushing me to act like

 everything is normal. I guess we're just supposed to stuff everything down

 and move on. But that's impossible. The girls are playing poker and

 acting like things are fine, and they're not. It is nice to

 be able to talk about this. Ohh. It is. Do you wanna

 get some coffee? Sounds good. Parker, it's me. It's getting late. Is

 everything okay? Everything is fine, m'lady. Who's this? Toph. If this is

 a booty call, Toph is ready to fill in. Where is Parker?

 I don't know, man. It's kind of a \"Lord of the flies\"

 situation here. So... are we hooking up or what? Oh! Parker! Parker!

 Excuse me, excuse me. I'm looking for my son, Parker Scavo... I'm

 hoping you know him. Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand!

 And now I'm hoping you don't. Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand!

 Keg stand! Whoa, hold on. This is a private party. Uh, I'll

 just be a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you, some kind

 of narc? No, I'm just looking for my son, I swear. I'm

 not a narc. Exactly what a narc would say. Step aside, kid.

 Lady, I said no. Listen to me. My son is here somewhere,

 and he is probably drunk and probably terrified, and I have got

 to find him. Sorry. There's no way we're letting a narc into

 our party. I am not... Ugh! Okay. Would a narc do this?

 Legs! Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand! Lynette?

 Uh... Tom! This isn't what it looks like. I haven't been drinking.

 I mean, a little. What are you doing here? Parker called me

 to pick him up - because he drank too much. - Where

 is he? He's in the car. He sent me back because he

 lost his phone. Is he okay? He's covered in puke, which I'm

 hoping is-is his. Oh, god. This is your fault for letting him

 come here. My fault? You could have stopped him. Oh, please. You

 knew it was a bad idea. You were just too busy testing

 me. No, I was giving you a chance to stand up and

 be a father. Now we've got a 16-year-old son we have to

 clean off with a garden hose. I guess you showed me. He

 asleep? Yeah. I thought let him sober up before we punish him.

 I know I shouldn't have let him go tonight. But right now

 saying \"Yes\" is the only move I've got. \"Move\"? What is this?

 Some kind of game you're trying to win? Lynette, you have no

 idea what this is like for me. For 20 years, I had

 the same bedtime ritual. I-I brushed my teeth, and I'd go look

 at each kid sleeping, and no matter what crap happened during the

 day, I knew the things that mattered were okay. Now my ritual...

 I brush my teeth. So, yes. I'm doing everything I can to

 make the little time that I spend with them the best part

 of their week. Wow. You're succeeding. When I see them sprint out

 to the car, so excited to see daddy, part of me thinks,

 great. They're okay with this, and part of me thinks... oh, crap.

 I'm losing them to you. So you're trying to win, too. No.

 I just... I understand how you feel. And the only way we're

 gonna get through this Is if we stop worrying about... who wins.

 I'm sorry to burden you with this, but I just couldn't keep

 it to myself anymore. Why not? Why did you have to tell

 me? Repression is, like, your thing. Okay, let's-let's say someone knows. They're

 not asking us for money. They're not trying to blackmail us. I

 say until they tell us what they want, we just act like

 everything's normal. Except I'm drinking a lot more. You don't think we

 should tell the others? Well, we can't tell Susan. She's already flipping

 out. You're right. And we shouldn't tell Lynette, given what's going on

 in her marriage. Or Carlos, given what's going on in mine. So

 you don't think we should do anything? Well, there is one thing

 I've been telling you you need to do. Get rid of Chuck!

 You're right. I should, but, um... But what? This is gonna sound

 strange. He makes me feel safe. Safe? Yeah, I do think that's

 strange, especially now that some lunatic knows. But you've got to end

 this, and you've got to end it now. Chuck? Now isn't that

 funny? I was just thinking to myself, \"How am I gonna wash

 my back in the shower?\" And then you walk in. Serendipity, huh?

 Sorry. I'm gonna pass. Okay. Is, um... something on your mind? It

 can wait. - Bree... - Go ahead. Take your shower. Hello? I

 have a collect call from Fairview correctional institution. Will you accept the

 charges? Yes. Bree, it's Paul Young. I've been thinking about what you

 asked me... You know, who might have known about Mary Alice's note.

 Yeah? When I confessed to the murder of Martha Huber, I mentioned

 the letter to the police. Well, do you remember who these policemen

 were? The main detective was a tall guy with a short name

 like, uh, Pence or Vince. Was it Vance? Chuck Vance? Yes, that's

 it. I have to go. Okay. I know that was the shortest

 shower I've ever taken, but I... I really didn't like the look

 on your face before. Be honest with me, Bree. Are you about

 to break up with me? Of course not. In fact, let's get

 you back in that shower. Yes, in the divided world of the

 suburbs, everyone is looking for some way to make a connection. Some

 seek to connect by focusing on a greater good... Some by revealing

 a common history... Some by sharing a pain no one else can

 heal. Then there are those Who once sought to make a connection...
