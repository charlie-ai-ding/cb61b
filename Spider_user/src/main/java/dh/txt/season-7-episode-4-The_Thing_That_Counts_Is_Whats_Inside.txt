 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... Bree discovered she had a romantic rival. I've been

 looking a new hobby, and taking you down is as good as

 any. Susan got a bonus. For the girl who gets the most

 hits in a month. Since the prison didn't allow conjugal visits, this

 is our wedding night. Paul's bride said no. There are certain wifely

 duties that I don't want to rush into. Once we call these

 people, it'll change your family forever. And Gaby decided to meet her

 real daughter. Call them. Carlos Solis loved his wife more than anything...

 If there's a woman on this planet with better skin, I'd like

 to meet her. Even though she was vain... Do we have to

 give money to the church every sunday? I mean, it's always the

 same show. Selfish... I told you to buy me couture! I can't

 wear off-the-rack with these shoes! And spoiled. But in those moments when

 his wife was simply vulnerable... You okay? Carlos loved her just a

 little bit more. This is where we're meeting them? I think so.

 I don't know what I'm supposed to say. Start with \"Hello.\" And

 then what? \"Thanks for raising our daughter for the last eight years.

 Hope we didn't ruin yours\"? It's gonna be fine. Mrs. and Mrs.

 Solis? I'm Hector Sanchez. Nice to meet you. And please, call us

 Carlos and Gabrielle. Thank you. Where is... Juanita is at the swing

 set with her sister. We thought we should talk a little first.

 Sure. My wife is over here with our... She's with Grace. That's

 her name? Grace? Yes. So how are you and your wife handling

 all of this? We're still in shock. Since your lawyer called us,

 we haven't been able to sleep or eat. This whole thing is

 so crazy. We feel the same way. They couldn't have switched our

 babies. It's got to be a mistake. Maybe we should take a

 blood test. I told you to bring the green jacket! I can't

 wear red with these shoes! Yes, Carlos Solis loved his wife... I

 don't think we'll be needing that test. And he knew her DNA

 when he saw it. It's called a purse, and as every woman

 knows, it can hold just about anything, from a personalized cell phone...

 to a romance novel... to much-needed medication. Whatever you find inside, there's

 one thing you can be sure of, every purse says something about

 the woman who owns it... Whether she knows it... or not... Carlos

 and I feel like we shouldn't tell the girls, you know, about

 what happened. What do you guys think? We should protect them. Yes,

 but since we wanna get to know our biological daughters, we were

 thinking maybe the families could - get together every now and then?

 - Maybe once a month? That sounds reasonable. What do you think,

 Carmen? I guess. Look at them. Yes, I have a feeling that

 they will become very good friends. Can you believe those are our

 daughters? Grace looks just like me when I was her age. And

 Juanita looks so much like my mother. Mommy, can I have money

 for ice cream? - You just had lunch. - But they have

 chocolate chip. Let her have some. It's hot. Come on. It'll be

 my treat. Your purse is beautiful. I know. Would you like to

 hold it? It's so soft. I bet it cost a lot, right?

 Grace, you don't ask about money. I'm sorry. That's okay, sweetie. And

 just so you know, it's Chanel. You can have one of these

 by working very hard... Or by marrying a man who works very

 hard. Thank you! What a polite little girl. You have obviously done

 a wonderful job, Mrs. Sanchez. We didn't know what to expect, but

 I can see Grace couldn't have had a better mother. You know

 what I mean. You've done a wonderful job with Juanita. Thank you.

 When I got pregnant, I didn't know how I would handle the

 motherhood thing. But I think I turned out to be pretty good

 at it. - Mom! - What?! I need money for ice cream.

 What is the magic word? I don't know. \"Hurry\"? Now come on.

 The truck's pulling away. \"Please.\" The magic word is \"please.\" Fine. Please.

 What, we can't afford more than one scoop? I'm sorry. What was

 I saying? You were talking about what a good mother you are.

 Say good-bye to your truck loan. God, can you believe it? Just

 two months ago, we were up to our neck in debt. Now

 we're only up to our ass. If we keep this going, we

 could reach flat broke in time for Christmas. Hello? It's Maxine. I'm

 in here with Mike! It's open! Look at this punim. Mike, if

 I was 15 years younger, I'd ride you like a hobo rides

 a boxcar. Thanks. But you still have to fix the air conditioner.

 It was worth a shot. I'm gonna take a shower. I need

 to talk some business with you. Me, too. I just bought a

 fur-trimmed teddy and some floor polish. Tomorrow is gonna be a heck

 of a show. Fantastic. I think you should quit. What? The web

 site's going through some changes. I've taken on some partners who are

 pumping a lot of cash into the business, and they're running the

 show now, and they want a huge US presence. You promised me

 that no one here would ever see me. I did, and that's

 why you need to get out now. But Mike and I are

 just getting back on track. Yesterday, we got our first water bill

 that didn't come with a threat. Honey, I'm sorry. How long do

 I have till all this happens? A couple of weeks, a month

 tops. Okay. I'll work right up until the last day. Give me

 double shifts, extra shows. I'll do anything. You got it. I'm gonna

 miss you, honey. No one will ever wear the rubber gloves and

 the fishnets like you do. We get it. You're unhappy. We got

 it in every aisle at the market, we got it four times

 during the night, - and we get it now! - Mom, I'll

 put the groceries away. Stop. Freeze. Do nothing. No sudden movements. The

 eyes are closing. But we bought ice cream. Let it melt. Yes,

 this is she. Of course I did. Thank you. Thank you. I

 will be back. Everything okay? I left my license at the store,

 so I have to drag paige back there, which will lead to

 another 2-hour screaming fit. If I didn't look so good in that

 photo, I'd get a new one. - Why don't you leave the

 baby with me? - Honey, I don't know. You leave her with

 the boys, and they don't change her diaper until it weighs as

 much as she does. Good point. I'm back. I'm back! Everything okay?

 She woke up, so I went with plan B. You traded her

 in for a quieter baby? I changed her diaper. Now we're doing

 a little floor time. You changed her diaper. Where'd you learn how

 to do that? I've seen you do it a hundred times. You're

 so good with her. How would you feel about me taking a

 quick shower to wash some of this vomit out of my hair...

 from yesterday? Why don't you take a bath? Light one of those

 scented candles. Whoever raised you did a brilliant job! Shoot. I'm out

 of aspirin. Do you have a headache? My back is a little

 sore. You do realize that your back wouldn't hurt so much if

 you weren't sleeping on a couch every night. The couch is fine.

 I just pulled a muscle. Hey there. Congratulations. You are the proud

 new owner of your old house. You bought your old house? Why

 don't we talk later? Here are your keys, your complimentary endangered species

 calendar, and a kitchen magnet with my face on it. I know

 I look cross-eyed, but they assure me they'll correct that in the

 next batch. Enjoy. Why would you buy that house? Our lease won't

 be up for a year. I thought it was a good investment.

 But why buy that one? There are other homes for sale. Escrow's

 closed. I see no point in discussing this further. You won't discuss

 it? I'm your wife. Isn't it convenient how during the day you're

 my wife, but at night, you turn back into a houseguest? They're

 not done. This isn't about the shutters. It's about our date Friday.

 You still haven't told me what we're doing. I can't tell you

 yet, but I've been working on something that I'm pretty stoked about.

 That sounds lovely. I, too, am stoked. You got a little paint...

 What are you doing? Are you spying on Bree again? Why would

 he want her when he could have me? - She's way too

 old for him. - You're the exact same age. - I am

 not. I'm only thirty... - Are you gonna lie about your age?

 We were college roommates. Damn it. Besides, Bree's always looked young. When

 she used to go out with her grandkid, people would think he

 was her son. Wait. Bree's a grandmother? How did I not know

 this? Sweetie, I am taking the baby over to Gaby's. The girls

 are meeting for poker. I'll be back in a few. - You're

 not staying? - No. I'm really just doing a drive-by. Last week,

 Paige spit up on Gaby's couch, so now she's pretty much baby

 non grata. Why don't you just leave her with me? Then you

 can stay for your game. We usually play for a couple of

 hours. Give me a kiss. You'll be next door if I need

 you. Don't toy with me. I'm operating on two hours of sleep.

 I'm vulnerable. Go. We'll be fine. I love watching my baby sister.

 It's fun. Penny Lynn Scavo, you are officially my favorite. We are

 gonna leave everything to you in our will. Keep in mind we're

 poor, it's really more of a symbolic gesture. Listen, guys. Before we

 start... I've been keeping something from you, but I'm gonna tell you

 because you're my dearest and oldest friends. I've only known you two

 weeks, but I don't want to tell you to leave. See this

 picture? This is my daughter Grace. I can't imagine what you're going

 through. I'd be out of my mind. How can you function? We

 were knocked sideways at first, but since we met Grace, it's been

 a blessing. Thank God the parents are lovely. This is the kind

 of thing you see on the news. Who else knows about this?

 Very few people, and I need you guys to keep it that

 way. Of course we'll be discreet. Definitely, for Juanita's sake. Don't worry

 about me. Up until today, I thought you were Juanita. Tell us

 what it was like. Amazing. I looked into her eyes and felt

 that pull. You carried her for nine months. There's this one thing

 she did that was incredibly moving. She came up to me... And

 within two seconds of touching my bag, she knew it was expensive.

 Now that is a hallmark moment. You don't understand. When I was

 a kid, I used to sneak Vogues out of my aunt's hair

 salon and make my own high fashion paper dolls. I know what

 it's like to be that kid, with her face pressed against the

 department store window. Grace is me at her age. So I decided

 to do something for her. Her own little starter Chanel. You are

 the best mother ever. - What are you doing? - Please go

 home. I just wanna understand, that's all. Are we going to move

 here? Then why would you buy this house? It must be filled

 with so many unpleasant memories. I don't see any unpleasant memories. I

 see the couch where my wife and I would sit and have

 our morning coffee. I see the christmas tree in the corner by

 the fireplace. I see the chair where I would sit and read

 stories to my son. I was loved in this house. I had

 a real marriage here. Our marriage is real, Paul. It's... This is

 hard for me, and you keeping things from me doesn't make it

 any easier. You're right. There should be no secrets between us. Secrets

 are why this house is empty right now. Sorry I'm late, but

 I think you'll be happy when you hear why. Black Eyed Peas.

 Row 15, center. How cool is that? That's just... You like them?

 Of course. You sound a little underwhelmed. Not at all. I live

 to rock. I'm not as old as you might think. - Grandma!

 - Surprise! - What are you doing here? - Visiting. We're here

 all weekend. This is my daughter Danielle and this is my... Her

 son Benjamin. Danielle, this is... my friend Keith. We were just going

 out. Grandma! Look what I bought you! It's slippers. My grandma has

 bad circulation. Don't you, grandma? Please stop calling me that! You precious

 child. You guys came all this way. You should spend tonight together.

 If you guys had plans, you should go. We'll be fine. There's

 nothing more important than family. We'll go out another time. You're very

 sweet. Nice meeting both of you. Thank you so much. I guess

 I heard wrong. You seem to be bouncing back just fine. What

 are you talking about? When your friend called, you were having a

 hard time since Orson left. By any chance, is this friend named

 Renee? She sent us first class tickets. - I wish I had

 a friend like that. - Trust me. You don't. Come on. What

 the hell? Maxine, pick up. They're already putting up a billboard. You

 said they weren't gonna start advertising for a couple of... My God!

 Wait! Stop! You can't put that up there! That's me. People will

 see! My friends will see! Lady, with a body like that, no

 one's even gonna notice you have a head. You can't! Stop! What

 are you doin'? Protecting my dignity! Hey there, Mrs. McCluskey. Nice day,

 isn't it? I've seen better. What do you want? You're direct. I

 love that about you. Truth is, I was wondering if you had

 any interest in selling your home. Well, get ready to love me

 again. Aren't you tired of caring for this place? The big lawn

 and all these stairs? Yeah, your concern is touching. What's your game

 here? I just love this neighborhood so much, I'd hate to see

 this house fall into the wrong hands after you're gone. - I'm

 not going anywhere. - I hope you're right, but the years do

 have a way of flying by, and you might wanna unload this

 place while you still have the upper hand. Upper hand? Right now

 you're sharp as a tack. But one day, your hip will break

 or you'll suffer a massive stroke, and the doctors will say you

 can no longer live on your own. And when that day comes,

 potential buyers who don't care about you like I do will know

 that you're desperate. They'll smell the blood in the water. People will

 start smelling your blood if you don't get off my porch. All

 right. Didn't mean to upset you. My offer still stands. As I

 said, it all comes from my great love for this beautiful neighborhood.

 Be careful on those stairs now. Look who's missing her big sister.

 There. You are really so good with her. I'm gonna take a

 quick jog. Be back in 20 minutes. I've got a test today.

 I cannot be late for the bus. I hear ya loud and

 clear. I'll be back in 15. You might wanna smell her diaper.

 I think she left you a little present. - I need to

 talk to you. - Sure. You're jogging again. Where's the baby? Penny

 is watching her. It is the most amazing thing. Only when you've

 spawned as much as I have, do you learn the glorious truth...

 The older ones can watch the younger ones. Babies having babies, bad.

 Babies raising babies, genius! I'm happy for you. - You don't look

 happy. - That's why we need to talk. She flew them here

 first class? That is vintage Renee. A voracious libido and unlimited funds.

 A deadly combination. And now, she's taking Keith to dinner tomorrow night.

 - How did you find that out? - He called to make

 sure it was okay. Which it isn't. But what could I say?

 Don't say anything. Wait till she's crossing the street and run her

 over. No, I'm too fond of my car. You have to fight

 back somehow. It's the only thing Renee understands. But how? I mean,

 you know her better than I do. What could I do to

 humiliate her? She once slept with a rodeo clown. But he's a

 senator now. She's got this really weird belly button. But by the

 time he finds that out, they're already getting it on. She used

 to freak out whenever \"The Wizard of Oz\" was on TV. Why?

 It was the munchkins. There's something about little people that gives her

 the heebie-jeebies. Crap! Penny's gonna be late for school. Sorry I couldn't

 help. You helped. I'm sorry! I forgot my phone! Grab your stuff,

 and I'll drive you! Where's my baby? Stop breathing on my sister!

 Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo. I need to find my daughter Penny. We've

 been expecting you. Principal's office is in the back. Thank you. You're

 in so much trouble. You left your 2-month-old baby in the care

 of your 11-year-old daughter. What can I say? I'm not one of

 those helicopter parents. Come on. Give me a break. I am raising

 five kids. You have no idea how hard that is. Eight? Clearly,

 you're very competitive. I talked to Penny. You should know she's helping

 you out more than you realize. - What do you mean? -

 Do you know Penny takes the baby monitor to bed so she

 can get up for the feedings? She does? As a result, the

 poor girl is exhausted. She fell asleep in social studies yesterday. I

 had no idea. I will talk to Penny when she gets home,

 and I will fix this. Yes, that would be nice. You know

 what? Enough with the judgmental tone. Come on. Who among us is

 a perfect mother? Is everything okay? Everything's fine. I was just hoping

 Grace would be home. We were supposed to call first if we

 wanted to see the kids. I know, but I was in the

 neighborhood. Is she here? Could you give this to her for me?

 Thank you, but Grace already has a purse. Really? Is it Chanel?

 We bought it at a flea market for $2 and she's very

 happy with it. I know, but don't you think she'd like this

 one a little better? Not if she never sees it. Don't you

 think I would like to give my children nice things? We're not

 like you. We can't afford luxuries. We can barely afford the necessities.

 If you need help... What we need is for you to let

 us be who we are, not who you are. Good-bye, Gaby. Please,

 call next time. You said I had a month. I said I

 thought it was a month. It's the Internet. Everything moves very fast.

 - How many billboards are there? - They talked about a big

 ad campaign, so I guess a lot. You have got to call

 them. Get them to stop it, or at least put some other

 girl up there. Something! Honey, I tried to warn you. It's beyond

 my control now. Please help me. What if Mike sees me splayed

 across that billboard? He's gonna recognize those panties! He gave them to

 me for our anniversary! I'll make a call. Sorry I took the

 baby to school. I had a test, I didn't want to be

 late. You didn't do anything wrong. I did. Come here. Sit down.

 I understand you've been taking the baby monitor into your room. Just

 so you can sleep. I appreciate that, and I appreciate how often

 you have been looking after your little sister. You like to go

 see your friends and go jogging and stuff. Yeah, I do. And

 you're different when you get to do those things. You laugh more.

 You're not as cranky. You stay up late and play board games

 with us. I like that mommy better. I like that mommy better,

 too. But it's not your job to take care of me. Your

 job is to... watch television and eat way too much candy. And

 my job is to make sure that's all your job is. Off

 you go. That... - was really sweet. - I know. Get me

 a nanny. - What? - I am drowning here. You heard what

 Penny said. I'm not myself anymore. And when I'm not taking it

 out on the kids, I'm taking advantage of them. So I need

 help. How about if I pitch in more? What a lovely, hollow

 offer that you'll never back up. Get me a nanny. You bought

 an 8-year-old girl a $1,400 purse? Lighten up. It's not like I

 got her the matching wallet. So what did Carmen say? She went

 all \"grapes of wrath\" on me, 'cause God forbid that woman let

 her daughter have nice things. \"That woman\" is her mother, and I'm

 with her on this. You have no right to give Grace expensive

 gifts. - Yes, I do. - Why? 'cause she was supposed to

 have all this stuff! We were supposed to give it to her.

 This is why I didn't want us to look for her, because

 we had no idea what would happen once we found her. But

 you looked, and we met her, now we're in love with this

 girl. And if you spook these people, they can take her away

 from us forever. Morning, Mrs. McCluskey. How are you today? I feel

 great. Sorry to disappoint you. What? Just had my annual physical. Doc

 says I'm gonna be around for years. So you can tell that

 vulture husband of yours he'll have to pick at someone else's carcass.

 What are you talking about? Something smells good. I'm making stew. So...

 How was your day? Fine. Anything interesting happen? No, not really. You

 didn't... Talk to anyone? Who would talk to me? I'm gonna go

 wash up. You are going to love the sea urchin. Looks a

 little sketchy. Most of the fish I eat comes in a basket

 with fries. You're funny. And you eat out of a basket. I

 like that. Everything okay? I just thought I saw... Never mind. So...

 Anyway, I thought after dinner we could go to a club. What

 do you think of jazz? I think it's the sea urchin of

 music. Okay, um, did you see that? See what? It was probably

 nothing. I thought I saw... Okay, you're... You're just a kid. What

 is the matter with you? I'm so sorry. I don't want you

 to think I'm odd. You see, when... I was a child, there

 was this incident at the circus. And ever since then, I have

 always been terrified of... Hey! Don't I know you? Get him away!

 Get him away! - What's wrong?! - Is he there with his

 tiny hands? I can't look at his tiny hands! I am so

 sorry. I don't know what the hell she's doing. It's okay. Obviously,

 I made a mistake. My God. Did he go? I can't look.

 He's gone. So come down. Everyone is staring. You should've seen the

 look on her face. Well, I couldn't see her, but I certainly

 heard her... And it was magnificent. Happy to help out. Bye, Bree.

 See ya in church. $9,000? My partners spent a lot of money

 printing those billboards. And they'll agree not to put them up, but

 they are not gonna eat the cost. Honey, I did the best

 I could. I talked them down from $12,000. It's still a huge

 hit. It puts us right back where we were before I started

 doing this stuff. I know. And what's Mike gonna say when he

 notices the money is missing? I hadn't even thought of that. Maybe

 I should just let them put up the billboards. At least then

 when he kills me, I'll be famous. You know, there is another

 way. What do you mean? Well, you could earn that money back,

 and fast, too. But you'd have to... Never mind. Forget I said

 anything. No, no. What? What is it? Well, there are other services

 our web site provides. Things I've kept hidden from you because of

 the boundaries you've set. But if you're willing to go beyond those

 boundaries... Are you talking about prostitution? God, no! Nothing like that! Just

 private onscreen interactions of a... racier nature. How racy? How much money

 do you wanna make? How dare you. Good morning, Renee. How dare

 you exploit a traumatic childhood memory. Yes, I heard you had some

 sort of episode with a little person. Oh, look. He followed you

 home. Very funny. I wonder how Keith will react when I tell

 him it was you who ruined our date. About the same as

 when he finds out you used my grandson to ruin ours. Here's

 Keith now. Why don't we ask him who he wants to be

 with? We can't... Put him on the spot like that. Bree, you're

 getting all red. Is that a hot flash or you just losing

 your nerve? I was gonna finish up with those sconces. Everything okay

 here? Not exactly. Can we ask you something? If you had to

 choose between... Forest green or brown for the trim, which would you

 prefer? Forest green... I guess. Great. Then why don't you, run down

 to the hardware store and have them mix you up a batch?

 Scoot. What's the matter, Bree? Afraid you'll lose? You know what? I

 think I am. He's all yours. Well, that's not any fun. I

 thought you liked him. I do, but I don't get his references.

 I can't stay up late like he does. I'm being silly. I

 feel like one of those clich?s people make fun of... The desperate,

 predatory divorc?e. You mean like me? Well, yeah. Do you know why

 people make fun of us? They're jealous, because we still have the

 guts to go after what we want. You think he can make

 you happy? I think so. Then go for it. My gift to

 you. Why are you being so nice to me? Based on my

 dinner under the rainbow last night, I'd rather have you as a

 friend than an enemy. Now go. Keith, hang on! I think I'll

 join you! Really nice of you to have us over. Next time

 you can come to our house. Absolutely. You know, I think it's

 great that out of this unfortunate situation, we could all end up

 being friends. Yes. We're very lucky people. Bet you can't catch me!

 So now we pinch off a small piece of masa, and you

 roll it into a ball. - Is this big enough? - It's

 perfect, honey. I really love your house, Mrs. Solis. Well, thank you,

 honey. Would you like a tour? Come on. It's so big. You

 have a TV in your bedroom? - Lucky. - Yes, we are

 very lucky. Is that a jewelry box? You want to take a

 look? It's all so pretty. I can't wait till I grow up

 so I can have beautiful things. You like that? It's a gift

 I bought myself with my first big modeling check. I want you

 to have it. You deserve beautiful things. I don't know. My mom

 might get mad. Then we'll make it our little secret. Thank you.

 I want a purse like that someday. Well, then I'm gonna make

 sure you get it. It's called a purse, and as every woman

 knows, it can hold just about anything... From a bottle for a

 baby... To a check for protection... To a gift for a new

 friend. Whatever you find inside, there's one thing you can be sure

 of... Every purse says something about the woman who owns it... Whether
