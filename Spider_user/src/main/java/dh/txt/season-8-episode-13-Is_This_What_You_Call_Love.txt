 ":"Previously

 on \"Desperate Housewives\"... I'm done feeling sorry for myself. Lynette made an

 announcement. I need to start dating again. - But her first attempt...

 - Oh, the salmon looks good. At a steak house? Was a

 disaster. The stress of covering up a crime... You told us that

 as long as we trusted each other, everything would be fine. You're

 on your own! Drove a wedge between Bree and her friends... A

 night out is exactly what you need to lift your spirits. Leading

 her back to an old addiction and down at very dangerous path.

 Being in love can bring out the worst in people. They may

 become stingy... Or hostile... Or simply indifferent. But in the beginning when

 love is still a promise, people bring their best to the table.

 Here's to second chances. Oh, here's to you for giving me a

 second chance. I really... didn't expect you to be so nice on

 the phone. I guess you were charmed by my groveling. But now

 I'm kind of in a pickle. I spent the last week complaining

 about the crazy bitch I went out with. Now I have to

 go back and tell everyone this is one of the best dates

 of my life. Aw, that's so sweet. Ah, not so fast. We

 haven't had dessert yet. We still could blow it. Oh. I hadn't

 thought of that. Well... how about we get outta here? We could

 have dessert at my place. That sounds great. So I have half

 an apple pie. I've got some of those little pudding cups, and

 I think there are some ice cream sandwiches in the freezer. Oh.

 Come on. Who can resist a pudding cup? No, I-it's just... I

 didn't realize that you actually invited me over here for... dessert. Oh.

 Dessert. You thought I meant... Sex. Right. That's... why you ran all

 those red lights. I figured you had a sweet tooth. Yeah. So

 just the three choices? I think so. Don't get me wrong. I

 love dessert... both kinds. It's just so soon, and it's only our

 second date. Only the first one that's gone well... I get it.

 No problem. Plus there's a certain... Amount of prep work involved that

 I would have done had I known we were thinking of... and

 I didn't make my bed, and there are no clean towels. I

 misunderstood. And now I've made you feel uncomfortable. - I'm so sorry.

 - No. We had a great night. Yes. I look forward to

 doing it again. Oh, yes. Sounds good. Okay. Just... please don't think

 that this means I never wanna have sex with you, 'cause you're

 great, and... and sex is great. I love sex. I always have.

 I was a total whore in college. All right, well, I guess

 this is good night, then. Okay. Good night. Yes, the promise of

 love can bring out the best in us... Unless we find that

 we're a little out of practice. After a disaster, every housewife has

 her own way of coping. Some turn to drink... Some turn to

 sweets... And some turn to the people they trust the most. So

 then I said I'd love to have sex with him, but I'm

 not sure I'm ready yet, and now we're going to have this

 awkward thing hanging over us. Nobody expects you to hop right into

 bed with someone new. Why not? Tom did. I'm just trying to

 motivate her. To do what? Have random sex with the first guy

 she meets? You don't wanna be that girl. Yeah, because that sounds

 like too much fun. Susan, Lynette is pushing 50. With a very

 long stick. Point is, she should be out there getting some while

 she's still limber enough to enjoy it. Are you supposed to be

 on my side here? Of course. First things first... do you really

 like this guy? Yeah, I think I do. Then what's the problem?

 Well, for starters, I'm a little rusty. It's been a while. The

 last guy who saw me naked told me not to wait so

 long between pap smears. Oh. Okay, you're putting too much pressure on

 yourself, and if you really like this guy, you should take it

 slow. Yeah, but not too slow. You're starting a new relationship, and

 sex is a big part of it. You don't buy a car

 without giving it a test drive. So drive this guy, Lynette. Drive

 him hard. So... how much longer is Carlos gonna be in rehab?

 141/2 days. I don't know. The first time with somebody is always

 awkward and weird. And exciting and great. Come on. In 20 years

 of marriage, you never fantasized about being with someone else. Constantly. Sometimes

 during. Well, here's your chance. Huh. I guess this is the upside

 to having your marriage collapse. Okay. I just have to figure out

 how to make my first move. I know who could give you

 some tips. Oh, my God. Is that another one? I know. What

 happened to the blond guy from last week? Blond guy? The guy

 I saw had dark hair and a sports car. The guy I

 saw drove a motorcycle. What is that, five guys in a week?

 Is she starting a basketball team? Should we be worried about her?

 After the way she treated us, unh-unh. She's not our problem anymore.

 Who are these women staring at us? Nobody I know. Juanita, why

 do you insist on giving out Valentine cupcakes when I bought you

 a box of perfectly good cards? Store-bought cards are lame. Who cares?

 I could be watching TV right now instead of trying to cram

 the name \"Harrison\" onto a cupcake. I wish daddy was here. He

 always helps me with stuff. You really miss him, huh? Yeah. Why'd

 he have to go to stupid Europe, anyway? Well, you know, business

 trips are very important. That's why they call them... Business trips. But

 he's never been gone this long. It feels like forever. I know,

 but when he gets home, everything's gonna be great again. Do you

 have any more of those sprinkles? You're spending a lot of time

 on that one cupcake. Is it for someone special? No, it's for

 nobody. Juanita, what's his name? He doesn't have a name. Ha! So

 you admit he exists. Fine. His name is Ryan Vayo. He's so

 cool. He can dislocate his shoulder so it looks like he was

 in a car accident. Mm. You and me... we go for the

 bad boys. So I just want it to be special. Do you

 think that's dumb? No. I think you need more candy hearts. Hey,

 I've been, uh, I've been meaning to ask. Do we have any

 cereal? It's for Julie. For the rest of her life? When she

 was a kid, our favorite thing was to have cereal dinner. But

 I couldn't remember her favorite, so I got 'em all. I can't

 believe it's been six months since she's been home. Yeah. Why the

 visit? I think she just misses her mom. She sounded a little

 blue on the phone. Well, we should think of some stuff to

 cheer her up. Way ahead of you. We are gonna do all

 the things she loved to do when she was a kid. Oh,

 hey. Do we still have that trampoline in the garage? She would

 jump on that thing for hours. I would be up in my

 room, reading, and her head would keep popping up in the window.

 \"Hi, mom. Hi, mom. Hi, mom.\" - Hi, mom. - Oh! Julie.

 Hi. Hey, Mike. Hey, kiddo. You look great. Oh, you do. You

 look wonderful. Can I get you something? Uh, yeah, sure, some water.

 - Oh. - Here. We are gonna have so much fun this

 week. I thought we'd start at the amusement park with some high-risk

 roller coastering. Uh... Susan? And then I am gonna take you to

 my kick-ass kickboxing class. Yeah... uh, babe? And to top it off,

 Mike is gonna dig out that trampoline so that you can... oh,

 my God! Yeah. I don't think we're gonna be needing that trampoline.

 Oh, my God. You're... pregnant. Yeah. Six months. You didn't even tell

 me you were in a relationship. Oh, God. Is there something wrong

 with the guy? I'm gonna hate him, aren't I? No, 'cause... You're

 not gonna meet him. It was just kind of a casual thing,

 and he's not really interested in following through. I was right. I

 do hate him. And you're okay with that? Mm, yeah. Yeah, I

 am. Then we are, too. Of course. And we are gonna be

 here for you. You can move back home, and Mike and I

 will help take care of the baby. Oh, my God. I can't

 believe I didn't even ask. Is it a boy or a girl?

 It doesn't matter. I'm giving it up for adoption. What? No, you're

 not. Mom, look at my life. I-I live in a crappy apartment.

 I'm working part-time while I finish my PHD. But you always said

 you wanted children. Yeah, with a husband. I'm not in a place

 to do this right now. No, no, no. Slow down. We need

 to think this through. I already have. And I'm working with this

 agency, and they set up a meeting with a great couple who

 doesn't live too far from here. Oh, God. I'm supposed to meet

 them tomorrow night, and they wanna meet you, too, to learn about

 my background. So that's why you came home... not just to break

 my heart. Okay, well, guess what? No one is meeting anyone, and

 no one is going to give away this baby. Susan. Mom, you

 just said you'd be there for me. I really need your support.

 Please? Okay, I'll do it. We'll have them over for dinner. Thank

 you. Happy sucky Valentine's day. What happened? Ryan didn't like your cupcake?

 He ate it, but he didn't even give me a card. Oh,

 who cares about him? Plenty of other people gave you valentines. Like

 Jacob. \"Dear Juanita, my parents... Made me write this. You smell like

 Ham.\" Well, you like Ham. I like Ryan. Why doesn't he like

 me? What's wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you. You are

 wonderful. Come here. Oh. Hey, sweetie, are you sure Ryan didn't give

 you a card? Yeah. Maybe you should double-check your backpack. He could

 have slipped it in when you weren't looking. Why would he do

 that? Boys are weird. Take a look. Pen, pen, pen, pen. No.

 What are you doing? Nothing. Hey, what's, uh, what's that? What? That

 thing that just fell out of your backpack. Oh, my God. Oh,

 my God! It's from him. \"Happy Valentine's day. X.O.X.O. Ryan.\" What's \"X.O.X.O.\"?

 Hugs and kisses. Hugs and kisses? Oh, he does like me. I'm

 going to call him. No, no, no, you can't do that! -

 Don't do that! - And why not? Because boys don't like it

 when girls tell them they like them. Then how will he know?

 Oh, sweetie, he knows, you know, so neither of you need to

 say it. It's much more romantic this way. I'm serious. Don't talk

 to him, ever. It'll wreck the relationship. But... if we don't talk,

 what kind of relationship is that? The very best kind. Oh, my

 God. Is this... Chocolate? He's perfect! Susan, this was delicious. Ah, just

 a little something I whipped up. A toast to Julie and Susan

 for inviting us into your beautiful home, and offering us this amazing

 gift of life. You're not drinking, Debbie? Oh. I'm abstaining in a

 show of solidarity with Julie. I may not be able to carry

 my own baby, but I can support the woman who is. Oh,

 that's sweet. But word of advice... drop that plan when the doctor

 starts talking episiotomy. Oh. - Susan, I can't believe how great you're

 being about this. - Yeah. It's wonderful that your mother is so

 supportive. Yeah, well, she understands how this is going to be so

 much better for everyone. Absolutely. Can't think of a better home for

 this baby than with the two of you. Oh. Julie, do you

 mind getting the dessert? Oh, sure. And, Debbie, if you're peeing in

 solidarity with me, then, uh, that's where I'll be heading first. Aw.

 You have done an incredible job with her. She seems great. Yeah.

 She's having one of her good days. Her good days? Yeah. Seems

 Dr. Cohen finally got her meds perfectly balanced. It's why I'm letting

 her use a knife tonight. Wait. Meds? She never mentioned anything on

 her application about... mental illness? Yeah. Grandma used to say our family

 tree grew nothing but bananas... Before she hung herself. I think legally

 she had to disclose this to us. Oh, don't talk to Julie

 about legal. Then we'll have to see all of her jail tattoos.

 Bill? Um... what else didn't she tell us? I don't know. Did

 she tell you she can hold her hand over an open flame

 without crying? Yeah, her eyes water, but she just keeps laughing and

 laughing. But it's not all her fault. I should've stopped drinking when

 I was pregnant, but I likes my wine. I'm back. Who's ready

 for dessert? You don't have to do that. Still not talking to

 me, huh? I'm channeling my anger into cleaning. Well, I was going

 to apologize, but maybe I should wait until you tackle the bathroom.

 You do realize that scaring those people off doesn't change anything. I'm

 healthy. I'm white. I'm a year away from my PHD. You can't

 imagine how many people want this baby. Including me. I'm sorry. It's

 my grandchild. And I know that you think you have thought this

 all out, but until you have held that baby in your arms,

 you have no idea what you're giving up. I'm going to bed.

 No, please, hear me out. You're scared. I get it. But you

 can do this. I don't wanna be a single mother! Why can't

 you respect that? It's not so bad being a single mother. We

 had a great time. We were like best friends. Remember? We would

 have cereal for dinner, and we'd stay up in my bed all

 night, telling each other our secrets. It's funny you remember it that

 way, because I don't. I was 12, mom. I slept in your

 bed because you couldn't handle looking at the empty side. And how

 about those fun drives past dad's apartment to see if he was

 bringing anyone home? And the only reason we had cereal dinner was

 because that's the only food I could make, since you were too

 upset to cook. Uh... wow. I... I had no idea. That is

 why I don't wanna have this baby on my own. Because I

 already raised a child... You. What are you staring at? Shh. Don't

 talk. Why not? You'll ruin our relationship. Oh, we don't have a

 relationship. Right, that's why you gave me the X-O's. X-O's? What's that

 mean? I'll show you. Sexual harassment? Are you kidding me? She's a

 9-year-old with a crush, not a presidential hopeful. Regardless, here at oakridge,

 we have a zero tolerance policy for unwanted advances. Honey, I was

 a model. I know all about unwanted advances. Try being being stuck

 in a limo with a tipsy David Lee roth. Your daughter forced

 this boy to the ground and kissed him against his will. Oh,

 and we all know how much boys hate being kissed. He cried

 for 20 minutes. He could barely tell me what happened. Oh, so

 he's a snitch and a crybaby. That kid's not gonna last a

 day in high school. Mrs. Solis, I don't think you realize the

 gravity of this situation. I mean, it's not like when we were

 kids. Hey, hey, cotton top, you and I are not the same

 age. You need to talk to your daughter, because if she so

 much as glances in that boy's direction again, we will have no

 choice but to expel her. Mmm. Hey. Hi. I don't usually do

 this, but I'm feeling rather bold tonight. Can I buy you a

 drink? Sure. Matt, drink for my friend here. What's your poison? Whiskey,

 straight up. I'm Bree, by the way. Jerry. Jerry. Nice to meet

 you, Jerry. Not much of a talker, huh? Well, that's okay. I

 will ask all the questions. What do you do for a living,

 Jerry? I'm a roofer. Same thing I was two nights ago when

 you took me home. Jerry. Jerry, I'm so sorry. Ohh! It's just

 so dark in here, and I... it's okay. It happens, especially with

 this crowd. Well, I can assure you that I will not forget

 you twice. Is there, uh, any way I can make it up

 to you? Well, I, uh... I do remember the other night. Mm?

 And, yeah, you have several ways. Well, then, um... Let's not waste

 any time. Hey, kid. Want a beer? Oh, right. Thanks. It's so

 weird to remember being a kid here and... Now to be... Yeah,

 I'll bet. Imagine how weird it is for your mom. I get

 that. I just wish she'd... Julie, if you're about to wish that

 your mom would stop trying to figure out your life for you,

 you're about to waste a wish. Sounded like you were kinda rough

 on her last night. I was. She told you, huh? The fact

 that she didn't tell me is how I knew it was rough.

 I was just really angry. It's like she doesn't realize this whole

 thing is killing me, too. No, believe me, she does. That's why

 she won't stay out of it. Well, it's not making it any

 easier on me. When it comes to her kids, your mom has

 one gear, Julie... love. That's it. And if you sort through all

 the times in your life that she drove you nuts, what she

 did, what she said, or how she acted... You're gonna find love.

 I know. And... as far as flaws in a mom go... That's

 a pretty good one. What's the big deal? I kissed him. It's

 a free country. Well, some people at school think that's inappropriate to

 do on the playground. Oh. Well, I know a spot at the

 park where we can kiss. No, no, no, no kissing Ryan anywhere.

 But that's how it works. First, kissing, then get married, then he

 buys me presents. Oh, my God. You are my daughter. Honey... Uh,

 I don't think Ryan likes you like that. What do you mean?

 He sent me a Valentine. Actually, he didn't. I did. I signed

 his name, and I let you think it was from him. It's

 just when you didn't get a Valentine, you seemed so upset, and

 I just wanted to see you happy again. I'm sorry, Juanita. I

 hate seeing you sad like this. I'm not sad. I'm mad. You

 always lie to me. I don't lie to you. Okay, then, where's

 daddy? 'Cause I know he's not in Europe. How do you know

 that? I can tell. I'm not a kid anymore. I know when

 you're hiding stuff. Well... You're growing up so fast. Oh, honey, a

 part of me still sees you as this cute little baby I

 used to bathe in the sink. But every day you're getting stronger

 and smarter. So maybe I don't need to protect you quite so

 much. Why don't we get some cupcakes? You and I are gonna

 have a little talk. Mom... What are you doing? Don't worry. I'm

 putting them away. Aw. Remember these? No, mom, I was 1. I

 had a pair that matched. People would always look at us. Because

 you were a grown woman in pink striped overalls. They probably thought

 we were a Christian singing group. They'd say we looked sweet together.

 I wouldn't trade that memory for anything. I know this is hard.

 And I'm really sorry for the way I went off on you.

 No. I'm the one who should apologize. I had no right to

 lie to those people. And I know that I made mistakes with

 you... a lot of them. I guess I just told myself it

 was okay because you turned out so great. You did the best

 you could. I know that. You're a great mom. I'd do it

 again in a heartbeat. Because no matter how hard it was... You're

 always the best thing in my life. Mom, I've given this a

 lot of thought. And it's the toughest decision I've ever had to

 make. But I've made it. I understand. I'm just trying to do

 what's best for her. \"Her\"? It's a girl. Hey, you. Sorry I'm

 late. Stupid traffic. We should get a move on if we're gonna

 make our reservations. No. No, no, we have time. Come on in.

 So can I, um, get you anything before we go? Coffee or

 a drink or... Dessert? Dessert? We haven't eaten yet. I know. I'm

 talking about... dessert. I'm not falling for this again. Are you talking

 about... sex. I'm talking about sex. Would you like to have sex?

 - Now? - Mm. You said the kids are at your ex's

 all night. We could still go to dinner. No, no, no, no,

 'cause then it'll be hanging over our heads all night, and I'll

 be drinking too much and laughing too hard at your jokes, and

 I really don't have any more reasons, so could we please just

 go have sex? Mmm. I was kinda hoping that we could leave

 that on. Five kids. Trust me. It's better off. Oh, you have

 nothing to worry about. You look amazing. Tell you what. I turn

 the bedside lamp on, and you get the candles. How about... I'll

 see your bedside lamp... And I'll raise you.. A floor lamp? Unh-unh.

 Floor lamp's out. I'm not going over 25 watts. Uh, how about...

 Closet light on... And I'll crack the door, and... You... Get to

 keep the candles? Sorry. That's as high as I can go this

 round. Then I'm all in. Oh! Lynette? Sweetheart? What is going on?

 I couldn't understand your message. That's what you left on my machine.

 Can you use your words, please? Is this about your date with

 Frank last night? Grunt once for a \"yes,\" twice for \"no.\" Did

 you have sex with him? Sort of. Sort of? What does that

 mean? I don't wanna talk about it. This is ridiculous. You called

 me over. Now tell me what happened. I cried. Oh, no. When?

 After? Right in the middle. God. Is there any way he didn't

 notice? I blew my nose in the sheets. Kinda hard to ignore.

 What made you cry? I opened my eyes, and... and I saw

 him... this lovely man I have a really nice time with... and

 I realized... My marriage is over. Now didn't you realize that when

 Tom took his girlfriend to Europe? No, I didn't, because that was

 Tom, and I kept thinking, \"boy, Tom's moving on,\" but this is

 me. This is really happening to me. Love bites, doesn't it? What

 did, uh, Frank do? He was really sweet. Handed me a box

 of kleenex, said all the right things. But trust me, I'm never

 seeing him again. Well, think of it this way. It cost you

 one guy to face the truth. Your marriage is over. Now you

 can move on just like Tom. Yippee for me. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna

 tell you the same thing I told Bree when I took her

 out drinking. The only way to live life is wildly. What? You

 took Bree out drinking? Yeah. Why? Is that bad? How the hell

 could Renee take her out drinking?! Doesn't she know Bree's an alcoholic?

 I have known Renee a long time, and she's not exactly what

 you'd call a detail person. Well... At least this helps explain the

 way Bree's been acting lately. I don't know. There's not enough booze

 in the world to justify the skeezes coming out of that house.

 How could we not know this? 'Cause we're not speaking to her,

 you know, 'cause of what she did. I was so mad. I

 thought I'd stay mad a long time, but now, knowing that she's

 hurting... It just seems mean. Yeah. I miss her. I miss us

 being us. So whatever happened, we need to put it behind us

 and go help Bree. Do you think we can get through to

 her? I don't know, but we have to try. Uh, you sure

 this is your house? What the hell? Wow. Booze, loose morals, and

 now swearing? Too late. There's no Bree left. Why are you in

 my house? This is an intervention, Bree. This isn't for tv, is

 it? 'Cause I'm married. I was gonna tell you. An intervention? You've

 gotta be kidding me. We're your friends. We wanna help. Get out!

 All of you! Not you. Idiot. Talk to us, sweetie. Why are

 you behaving like this? I don't know what you're talking about. It's

 not like we can't see what's going on. We know you're drinking

 again. And what about all these men? We know about that, too.

 Wow, can't hide anything from you girls, huh? And did you also

 know I tried to kill myself? What? Oh, my God. How'd that

 little nugget of information slip past my nearest and dearest friends? If

 this is a joke, it's not funny. It's not a joke. I

 checked into a motel room with nothing but a bottle and a

 gun. And you're wrong, Susan. It is funny... funny that the women

 standing here before me... Professing to be my supportive friends... - Are

 the reason that I was in that motel room. - Bree, stop.

 No! Don't give me this \"friends\" nonsense. All I ever was to

 you was the organizer, the problem solver, a leader when you needed

 one, which is exactly what I was that horrible night when we

 buried your stepfather. And I was so grateful for that. Liar! All

 of you, liars! Because as soon as it got rough, as soon

 as there was any trouble, it all became my fault, and off

 you went. We had no idea. I wish you would have told

 us. Oh, I tried. But even when I came to you to

 apologize, you slammed your doors in my face! Okay, fine, you're right.

 We did. We screwed up. We let this pull us apart, but

 that's not gonna happen again. Because no matter what you think, -

 we love you, Bree. - We'll do whatever it takes. We just

 want things to be back the way they were. Well, I don't.

 Frank. What's all this? Well, this I something I recently discovered called

 pizza. I think you're gonna like it. I'm sorry. Did we have

 plans? Nope. This is more of a stealth date. Every time we

 made plans, there's been too much pressure. So I figured, maybe things

 would be better if we sneak up on each other. Do you

 have some unresolved mother issues or something? Well, actually, my mother and

 I get along quite well. Why do you ask? Because that's the

 only reason I can think of of why you would keep coming

 back here. Oh, I can think of another. I like you. You

 do remember I cried in the middle of sex, right? Lynette, you

 lived with the same guy for 20 years. It only makes sense

 that he'd be in your head. And frankly, I'd think twice about

 you if he weren't. Is it weird to say \"Frankly\" when your

 name is Frank? Not until now. Look, I'm a guy. So obviously,

 I'm a complete idiot. But the one thing I do know is

 that if you're lucky enough to meet someone who's sexy, smart, and

 funny, and who actually likes you, you give that person all the

 time they need. Now where's your corkscrew? Uh, middle drawer on the

 right. Hey, hey. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mnh-mnh. Wait. I know you're

 more comfortable like this. Leave it on. Evening, Bree. The usual? I

 suppose it has become \"the usual,\" hasn't it? Yes, please. Hey. You

 know, I got a thing for redheads. Wanna see it? Charming. It's

 Bree, right? Listen, I just came here to have a drink. I

 really don't feel like talking. Yeah? Well... it wasn't the chance to

 have a conversation that brought me over. I beg your pardon? I

 know what you come here for. We can stop the game. We

 can stop everything, including this unfortunate encounter. Now please leave me alone.

 Wait. Wait, wait. So... so suddenly you're some high-class lady? Hmm? Give

 me a break. Everybody in this bar knows what you are. You

 want me to start a tab for you? No. No, I don't.

 I have to go. I'll drive. Please give me my keys. Come

 on, Bree. I see some of the dirtbags you drag out of

 this place. What? I don't make the cut? No, you're vile. Now

 give me my keys and get away from me. Whoa. This is

 a new low for me. I'm not good enough for the town

 pump. You know what? - I think we'll take my car. -

 Aah! I'm not going anywhere with you! Get your hands off of

 me! - You like a fight, huh? I can play rough. -

 Aah! Let go of me. Let go! You heard her. Let go.

 Orson! Hello, Bree. We'll catch up in a moment. If you're smart,

 you'll step away from her and go back to the hole you

 crawled out of. Buddy, I got a rule about not hitting guys

 in wheelchairs, but you... you're begging for an Asterisk. Turn it off!

 I also have pepper spray. - Orson, what are you doing here?

 How did you... - Your friends called me. They said you were

 going through a rough time. Orson, I've made such a mess of

 my life. Don't worry, dear. The one thing you and I were

 always good at was cleaning things up. Yes, love can bring out

 the best in us... The confidence to move on... The courage to

 tell the truth... The strength to keep hoping... But sometimes what surprises

 us most isn't what love brings out... But who it brings back.
