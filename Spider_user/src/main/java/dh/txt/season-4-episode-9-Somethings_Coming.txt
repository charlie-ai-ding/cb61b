 ":"Desperate

 Housewives S04E09 Something's Coming (VO+STFR&EN) Mrs McCluskey had reached her limit. Five

 kids are tough enough, but your husband makes six, and that's where

 I draw the line. An old friend paid Adam a visit. Sylvia.

 Aren't you gonna invite me in? After you ruined my life? I

 don't think so. You should've told the truth about us. Mike got

 help from an unexpected source. Victor! Victor lashed out. Well, get up!

 And Carlos and Gabby... We need to ask you a few questions.

 Sorry. I guess I don't remember anything. ... finally met their match.

 I remember everything. It was supposed to be a beautiful day. Kids

 should have been playing in the park. Husbands should have been doing

 their chores. Women should have been tending their flowers. But at 2:26

 that afternoon, a tornado came to Wisteria Lane, bringing with it unbelievable

 destruction. No one could have anticipated it, especially given how the day

 started. Sorry, can you say that again? I don't think I heard

 you right. - Carlos and I are back together. - Gabby, you

 just got married. And some of us gave you very expensive wedding

 gifts. You want the fondue set back? Fine. But don't act like

 it cost a bundle, because it clearly didn't. - I got you

 the fondue set. - Oh. Right. It's nice. - Oh, my God.

 This is gonna kill Edie. - You would think so, but no

 such luck. That vindictive hag told Victor everything. Victor knows? Yeah. And

 seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town, with various

 thugs and cops at his disposal, Carlos and I thought it would

 be safer if we got the heck out of Dodge. - You're

 leaving Fairview? - Yeah. This afternoon. - No! - You can't be

 serious. Look, we'll be back someday. We just have to wait till

 this all blows over. - I can't believe this. - I know.

 This is a lousy way to say goodbye, and I'm sorry, but

 I don't have a choice. Do you guys have any idea how

 much I'm going to miss you? Hey, you heard the news? A

 tornado just hit Mount Pleasant. And they think we could get one,

 too. You all better head inside and start getting ready. Go. You

 guys, go. Yeah. And we don't need to say goodbye anyway, because

 we're gonna see you real soon. And everything will be just the

 way it was. Sadly, this was not to be. In four short

 hours, one of these women would lose a husband, and all of

 them would lose a friend. But how could they have known this?

 It was supposed to be a beautiful day. By noon that day,

 a tornado watch was in effect on Wisteria Lane, and every one

 of its residents was preparing for the storm. Everyone, that is, except

 Gabrielle Solis, who was more concerned about another storm on the horizon.

 Mayor Lang, recovering from his injuries, will reportedly be released from the

 hospital tomorrow. Until then, the deputy mayor will be coordinating Fairview's emergency

 response as the city remains on tornado watch. I turned off the

 gas and locked your car in the garage. I'm gonna go grab

 my passport from the safe deposit box before they close the bank.

 What's wrong? They said Victor's getting out of the hospital tomorrow. Relax.

 We're gonna be gone before they give him his last sponge bath.

 And remember, the accountant's dropping off the papers for my Cayman Island

 account. I can't deal with that right now. I'm packing. Gabby, those

 documents give us access to $ 10 million. Multitask. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

 I told you just to pack the essentials. That's what I'm doing.

 Is that a boa? Carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where

 I don't need a boa, then I don't wanna go. Fine. You

 could be a little bit more sensitive. I had to say goodbye

 to my friends today. Yes, I'm sorry. I should probably go over

 and say something to Edie. Like what? \"Rot in hell, you maggoty

 whore\"? That woman ruined our lives. If she had kept her mouth

 shut, we wouldn't be running away. I know, but I can't help

 feeling a little guilty. I mean, do you ever even think about

 what we did to Edie? Who cares? Thanks to her, I'm giving

 up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe. So do me a

 favour and never mention her name again, unless it's followed by the

 phrase, \"that conniving skank.\" You think you can do that? - Hey,

 Lynette. - Hi. Did you hear they declared a tornado watch? -

 Scary, huh? - Yeah, well, don't worry about me. I'm ready for

 anything. It's sweet of you to drop by, though. - Oh, yeah,

 well, you're welcome. - Okay. - Can we stay in your basement?

 - What? Well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to a warning,

 we're gonna need a place to wait it out. Who exactly is

 \"we\"? We. Me, Tom, the kids. That family you've come to know

 and love. - All seven of you? - Yeah. Well, first of

 all, I only love four of you. - And second, no way

 in hell. - Mrs McCluskey, please. It's a small basement, Lynette. I've

 already invited Ida over. We just want to play some cards and

 wait this thing out in peace and quiet. We can be quiet,

 relative to the storm. Look, there's a shelter over at 3rd and

 Grove. - Why don't you go over there? - That's in the

 middle of skid row. You think I want my kids around a

 bunch of winos? Ida's off the wagon. It's not going to be

 much better here. I am asking you as a friend. Please? You're

 not gonna let this thing go, are you? Thanks. And don't worry,

 I'll have a talk with my kids. I promise they'll keep a

 lid on the destruction. - Relative to the storm. - Yeah. Dylan,

 we're fine. It's just a tornado watch. No, we paid a lot

 of money for this class trip, and I want you to stay

 and enjoy it. Tell Julie I'll keep an eye on her mom.

 Got to go. What the hell are you doing here? I just

 came to talk to Adam. I like your hair long. This is

 harassment. I will call the police. I don't think so. You'd have

 to tell them what happened with me and your husband. You don't

 want people knowing about that. In case you'd forgotten, Adam wants nothing

 to do with you. Oh? Didn't seem that way yesterday. He didn't

 tell you I stopped by? I hope he's not starting to keep

 things from you again. Here. I brought you a few things, in

 case there is a tornado. Wow. Tape, batteries, a radio. How'd you

 know I'd need this stuff? - An educated guess. - Hey, actually,

 since you're here... I was thinking that maybe it would be a

 good idea to tell Orson about Mike's, you know, drug problem. Good.

 Because I already told him. - You did? When? - Last week.

 I was afraid that Mike might go to Orson for pills. I'm

 sorry, so, Orson already knows about Mike? Did I do something wrong?

 No, no, you didn't do anything wrong. Thanks for the supplies. I

 don't believe a word you say. So you still don't think I

 slept with Adam? - Of course not. - Oh, well, let me

 paint a picture for you, me lying in his arms, him wondering

 out loud how he ended up marrying such a cold, hard bitch.

 Katherine, are you all right? I couldn't help noticing... Of course you

 couldn't. And everything's fine. Thank you. Hi, there. I don't mean to

 intrude, but are you all right? Not really, no. Would you like

 a nice cup of tea? The National Weather Service has extended the

 tornado watch to the tri-county area. Funnel clouds have been spotted in

 the counties of Mansfield and Webster... I can't believe you're being so

 nice. You don't even know me. Well, I know Katherine. And believe

 me, you're not the only person I've seen her reduce to tears.

 - Did you see her spit on me? - Yes. That was

 unfortunate. - lf you need any anti-bacterial soap... - No, I'm good.

 So, why on earth would Katherine treat you so dreadfully? Oh, she's

 just mad because her husband's in love with me. Really? I was

 one of his patients, back in Chicago. From the moment we met,

 there was this intense passion. - We tried to fight it, but

 we couldn't. - Well, you're only human. I know he's miserable without

 me. Even though she tries to pretend that they're happy. I mean,

 you're their neighbour. Do you think they're happy? - Well, they seem

 content. - Well, they're not. - It was just an observation. -

 Yeah, a stupid one. Okay. This has been lovely. We really should

 do it again sometime. You think I'm making this up? We were

 lovers! I can prove it! He has a snake tattoo on his

 right shoulder. I licked it. Be that as it may, I really

 think you should go now. No one believes me! She has you

 all brainwashed! Sylvia, where are you going? - Sylvia? You need to

 come out of there. - Ask Adam! He'll tell you the truth!

 Well, Adam is not here. And there is a tornado coming. And

 as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that

 bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out. So, would

 you please be a dear and come on out? Go get Adam!

 And open wide. Orson, we need to talk. - Susan? I'm with

 a patient. - Yeah, I can see that. Hi. I'm his neighbour.

 Cute shoes. Why the hell would you give Mike drugs? Mrs Kowalsky,

 we're going to step out for just a moment. No need. I'll

 be quick. Because I'm sure you have a very good reason for

 giving Mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem.

 So, what is your very good reason? Okay, this may take a

 while. You might want to spit. Mike was having a lot of

 pain with his shoulder. Oh, of course, and you know all about

 shoulder pain, being a dentist. - I thought I was helping. -

 By giving pills to an addict? Does that sound helpful to you,

 Mrs Kowalsky? - Thank you! Finally, some sanity! - Susan, you have

 to leave. Fine. But you know, if I find out that you

 have given Mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there

 is not enough Novocain in this office to numb the pain I

 will inflict on you. Hi, Miss Britt. Need some bottled water before

 the storm hits? - Well, thanks, Jeremy. - Twenty bucks. Hold it.

 You are price-gouging right before a tornado? - I was just trying

 to make some money. - You really want to make some money?

 Go hit up Gabrielle Solis. She hasn't met a price tag she

 didn't like. I already tried. She and Mr Solis are moving. -

 Moving? - Yeah. They're loading up their car and everything. They didn't

 tell you? Well, they probably didn't want a big, emotional scene. Too

 bad. What was I supposed to do, Mike, leave them in your

 truck? I'm not going to sit back and watch you spin out

 of control. Out of control? Have I ever missed a mortgage payment?

 - What? - Or disappeared for days on end? Or ODed in

 an alley? No. I go to work every day, I help out

 around the house, I take care of you and Julie. - What's

 the problem? - What's the problem? Let's see. You lied to me,

 your drug dealer almost dated my daughter, you lied to me some

 more, and then I find out that you hit up my best

 friend's husband for more pills. You're blowing this out of proportion! And

 you're kind of yelling at me, also a problem. I'm sorry. I'm

 in pain. You might think you have things under control, but they're

 only gonna get worse, and with a baby on the way... I'm

 sick of explaining myself. If I need a pill now and then,

 I'll take one. So where are they? I'm serious, Susan. Give them

 to me! - Forget it! - Hey! Don't walk away from me!

 - Susan! - Let go of me! And we are now getting

 reports of two more tornadoes touching down outside Mount Pleasant. We can

 confirm six dead and more than 200 injured... My wife needs to

 be seen immediately. She's pregnant and she fell down the stairs. -

 Any bleeding? - No. - Cramping? - I think I just twisted

 my ankle, but I would like to get checked out anyway. Sure.

 But for non-emergency cases, it's gonna be a long wait. Well, she's

 pregnant! Doesn't that make it an emergency? Sir, I'm sorry. You're just

 going to have to wait. It's okay. How could you not have

 told me Sylvia was here? - I was trying not to upset

 you. - Well, you failed. At least if you had warned me,

 I wouldn't have been blind-sided when she showed up on our front

 lawn! I'm sorry. Look, I'll call the police, I'll get a restraining

 order, I'll do whatever it takes to get this woman out of

 our lives. - Bree, hello. - Hi, Katherine. Could I borrow Adam

 for a second? I have a situation on my hands. She's over

 there. First door on the left. And please hurry. What is she

 doing there in the first place? I saw her weeping. I wanted

 to help. You wanted dirt. And I'll bet she told you plenty.

 I can't help having a sympathetic face. Sylvia, I need you to

 come out here, okay? Adam? - Is that you, darling? - Don't

 call him that! Katherine! I'm not coming out if she's here. I'm

 not leaving you alone with my husband. - Just come out! I'll

 get rid of her! - Ladies... So, what did she tell you?

 - That she had an affair with Adam. - Well, she didn't.

 She was his patient. A pathetic, Ionely woman. One day, for no

 other reason than sheer pity, he gave her a little kiss. Sylvia

 took this to mean that they were in love. And when Adam

 told her otherwise, she had a breakdown and accused him of sexual

 assault. Oh, my God. What did you do? We settled out of

 court. I wanted to fight it, but Adam was afraid of losing

 his licence. Of course, we lost everything else. Our home, our savings

 and our friends. So this is why you moved back to Fairview?

 It was supposed to be our fresh start. So... Now you know

 our dirty little secret. Well, Katherine, for what it's worth, I would

 have spit in her face, too. What's that noise? - Is that

 the tornado? - Worse. It's the Scavos. Hey, we're here! - I

 know! All right, guys, come on. Stake out your places. This is

 our spot! We called it! You can't call a spot this soon!

 Can so! My wrist! Lynette? I'm begging. Oh, sorry. Kinda get used

 to it. Come here, give that to Mama. Hey, guys, come on

 now, knock it off! Here you go. And first base, second base,

 third base. Sit! We're going to have a nice quiet tornado watch

 and nobody's gonna cause any problems. - Is there a cat here?

 - Oh, yes, I brought Toby. - Is something wrong? - I

 didn't realise there'd be a cat. - Tom's really allergic. - It

 sets off my asthma. Ida, is there any chance that we could

 put little Toby upstairs? - Upstairs? - Yeah, he'd be very safe.

 - We could put him in a closet. - Sure. Why don't

 we put Penny with him, since it's safe? - What? - Toby

 is Ida's baby, Lynette. No, Toby's an animal, and my husband, a

 human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so

 please put the cat upstairs. Look, I invited Ida to come here.

 You, I'm doing a favour for. If you're not happy with the

 accommodations, you're free to leave. Hey, I'll just stay over here. Maybe

 it won't get any worse. No, that's ridiculous. - Karen, come on.

 - Sorry. The cat stays. Knock yourself out. Are you okay? Yeah,

 I'm fine. I'm just worried about you. How long are they gonna

 keep us waiting? Are you sure that's all it is? Hey! Hey,

 we were here way before these people! Sir, they're seeing everyone on

 an emergency basis. This woman is haemorrhaging. Danny! Can you take her

 in? What, you gotta see blood before you'll treat somebody? My wife's

 pregnant and she fell down a flight of stairs! I'm sorry, but

 I'm gonna have to ask you to be patient. These people are

 bleeding. I can absolutely wait. I'm just asking them to take a

 look at you, okay? Hell, you could've done it while you were

 standing here talking to me, right? Sir, we'll get to your wife

 as soon as we can. - Now please take a seat. -

 Just take a look at her! - Get the hell off of

 me! - Mike, stop! I need security here now. Hey, we need

 help here! Doctor Ross, blood lab seven. Doctor Ross, blood lab seven.

 Hey. When are you gonna let me out of these things? When

 your wife's done and you're ready to go home. - The doctor

 said the baby's fine. - Oh, thank God. - Your ankle? -

 Just a mild sprain. - How are you doing? - I've had

 better days. I am so sorry. It's going to be okay. I

 talked to the doctor, and they have a rehab facility they work

 with. Thanks, but I don't need rehab. I can kick this myself.

 I've done it before. Well, you keep saying that, and it just

 keeps getting worse. Susan, look at me. I'm handcuffed to a chair.

 I think I've hit bottom here. I will fix this. Just no

 rehab. Mrs Delfino? The doctor asked me to give you these, for

 the pain. Oh, my God, are you kidding me? I've kind of

 had a rough day here. No. Susan, I've just got to get

 through this. No. There's no tomorrow. It's now. You will quit this

 now. You will go to rehab or so help me, I will

 leave you. I will take this baby and I will leave you.

 You win. I'll go. - Gabrielle? - Excuse me? Sorry, I'm in

 a rush. My wife's alone with the kids, and I have to

 get home before this storm hits. This is the information Carlos asked

 for. About what? About the Cayman Island account. Didn't he tell you

 I was coming? Yeah, of course he did, he said you'd be

 stopping by. Duh. This is everything you need to access the money.

 I've washed my hands of this, so whatever you do, don't lose

 that folder. Got it? Believe me, I won't let it out of

 my sight. All right. Nice to finally meet you, Gabrielle. You're just

 as pretty as Carlos said you were. Oh, no. I'm prettier. Edie!

 What have you got there? Oh, crap! Residents are advised to seek

 shelter at once. Again, do not evacuate, stay where you are and

 seek shelter in a basement or any windowless room... - You okay?

 - My throat is closing up. - I think I gotta go

 upstairs. - No, no, no. You stay here. - Edie, you thief!

 Open this door now! - I've called the police! They're on their

 way! And they are going to Taser your ass! Gabby? Oh, good.

 You're home. Lynette! What the hell did I tell you? I'm not

 going to sit and watch my husband suffocate. Well, I don't want

 Ida to wake up and find her cat missing. Karen, after all

 our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my

 husband? - You think we're friends? - Of course. Really? Do you

 ever stop by just to say hi, or invite me for a

 cup of tea? - Ida does. - What are you talking about?

 I had you over for lemonade last week. And while I was

 drinking it, you went to the store and I watched the kids.

 Face it, the only time we're friends is when you need something.

 That is not true. I genuinely care about you. You mean like

 today, when you came by to check on me? Oh, that's right,

 you only wanted a basement. Damn it, Toby! Hey, hold it, hold

 it! You can't go out there! That stupid cat is the only

 family that Ida's got! Now, this is what friends do! Karen! -

 Give me the damn folder, Edie! - Not gonna happen! It's worthless

 to you! Oh! You and Carlos are screwed without it, and that

 is worth a lot to me! - Give me my money! -

 Your money? - Carlos embezzled it! - Oh, now you're moral, all

 of a sudden? You didn't care where the money was coming from

 when you thought Carlos was gonna spend it on you! Okay, I'm

 not unreasonable. Cut me in for, say, 60% and I'll go away.

 How's that sound? Hey! You! Give it to me! - Give me

 that! - No! Let go, Edie! - No, you... - Let go!

 No! No! No! What did you do? What did you do, Edie?

 Get in the house! Now! Toby! Toby! Karen! - You've gotta get

 inside now! - He's right there! Damn it! I'm not going to

 let you die, so don't make me drag you! Oh, crap! Hurry!

 Go! Come on! Come on! Hurry! Get in! Get in! I have

 a crawl space. I think we can both fit. You just threw

 my money in a tornado! I am not getting in there with

 you! Fine! Then stay out here and die! Move your ass! Come

 on, Sylvia. Please open the door. Sylvia? Thank God you're here. We

 need to get into the bathroom. - We can't. There's a woman

 in there. - Well, tell her to hurry it up. No, no,

 she's barricaded herself in there. She's a patient of mine who's had

 a little meltdown. - Just give me five minutes. - We don't

 have time. There's a funnel cloud out there. Sylvia, open the damn

 door! Go to hell! Quick! In here! In here! Come on. Quickly.

 Come on! Hurry up! Here! Get in, get in! Get in! Hang

 on! Hang on to this! - Can I say something? - What?

 I'm sorry Carlos and I lied to you. I know we hurt

 you. And I wish it didn't happen the way it did. -

 And I just want you to know that. - Why are you

 talking like that? Well, I thought, just in case we... Oh, no,

 you don't! You just shut the hell up. We're not doing deathbed

 confessions here. We're gonna get through this, and I'm gonna go on

 hating you for years to come. - You really hate me? -

 Yes. No. It's just that I really let myself fall for him.

 Which was stupid, because I always knew that he'd go back to

 you. Well, I'm still sorry, though. I said, shut the hell up.

 I think it's possible Benjamin might need changing. That went beyond the

 hypothetical a good 10 minutes ago. We're giving you shelter. You could

 at least be gracious. We wouldn't need shelter if you hadn't dragged

 us over here. Oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic

 commandeered our safe room? If you hadn't been dying to know our

 business, - she wouldn't have gotten in there. - Can we stop

 pointing fingers? - This isn't Bree's fault. - You're right. Sorry. But

 you can understand why I'm upset, having that insane woman back in

 our lives. I can only imagine. I had to listen to her

 babble for an hour. What kind of things was she saying? She

 said that she and Adam were lovers, and she could prove it

 because he had a tattoo... What? She said he had a tattoo

 on his shoulder, which I know isn't true, because I've seen him

 at the pool, and I would have remembered, because tattooed people make

 me very uncomfortable. Did she say what kind of tattoo it was?

 A snake? What's the difference? He doesn't have one. He did. Back

 in Chicago. He had it removed. Oh... Sorry... - Katherine... - So,

 that's why we settled? Why we lost everything? I'm sorry, but you

 have to understand... No, I do not. Sorry. Not here. Not now.

 Gabby! Change of plans! We've got to get in the basement now!

 Gabby? Damn it, where are you? Where's Gabby? I thought she was

 with you. I don't know where she is. I guess we'll have

 to wait for her together. Do you mind if I say something?

 Gabby and I never planned to get back together, Victor. We tried

 to keep away from each other, we really did. But I don't

 know, it's like we're two halves of the same person or something.

 And when we're apart, we just aren't happy, which is why we...

 We never set out to hurt you, Victor. And I'm sorry we

 did. - Are you done? - Yeah. Come on, Carlos! Get back

 in the house! You could get hurt out here! Adam! Hello? Where

 is everyone? Did you hear that? Adam, I'm leaving! This is your

 last chance to come with me! Or I'm going to tell everyone

 exactly what happened! Okay. You've made your choice! Here I go! It's

 here! It was supposed to be a beautiful day. But then the

 winds came and changed everything. And not just the houses and the

 lawns. Oh, my God. The people had changed, too. While the storm

 had raged, each of them had learned something about friendship and forgiveness

 and redemption. And some had learned the hardest lesson of all, that

 life is always fragile, and very often unfair. Oh, my God! Oh,
