 Housewives S05E02 We're So Happy You're So Happy (Un bon voisin) (VO&VF+STFR&EN)

 Lives change in five years. Some families grow, while others grow apart.

 So I thought I'd bring him back sunday around 6:00 or so.

 Fine. And we find ways... It's not really a good time. to

 ease the pain. Yes, in five years... Edie, is that really you?

 I have a husband now. Many things change. You're required to check

 in once a month. It was a condition of your release. All

 in all, Susan Mayer's boyfriend knew he had a lot going for

 him. He was romantic... had a nice smile... and was consistently thoughtful.

 Yes, Jackson Braddock had many wonderful attributes. Sadly... a sense of timing

 wasn't one of them. Hello. Can I help you? I guess you

 could tell Susan I'm here. Who are you? Oh, I'm Mike... the

 ex-husband. I, uh, I take it you're... Jackson. I'm, uh... Susan's, uh...

 - Friend? - Friend. That's right. Could this be any more awkward?

 Well, your robe's open... so yeah. Hey, your ex-husband is... Mike! Uh,

 what's going on? I was just returning M.J.'s video game. He left

 it at my house. Thanks. So I guess you met Jackson. Yeah.

 Nice legs. Clearly this is not how I would've wanted the two

 of you to meet. He's really a nice guy. Yeah, well, just

 to make sure, I'm gonna need to hang with him a little

 bit, check him out. Oh, I don't know if that's necessary. If

 he's sleeping in the same house as my son, I think it

 is. Oh, well, first off, um, M.J. was at a sleepover last

 night. And, in fact, Jackson and he haven't even met, so, uh,

 there's really no need for you to be hanging or... checking. Tell

 Jackson I'll pick him up here tomorrow night. Hey, hold on. You

 don't get to just decide these things by yourself. You remember how

 nice I was about our custody agreement? I can haul you back

 to court tomorrow if I'm not 100% satisfied with who you expose

 my son to. Got it? Uh, I'm sorry. It's so not how

 I wanted to meet your ex for the first time. Well, when

 you meet him for the second time, you can tell him that.

 He's picking you up here tomorrow night. What? I'll explain over breakfast.

 Did you get the paper? And that is how Jackson Braddock realized

 he needed better timing... Who are you? And, a longer robe. If

 there is one thing everyone in suburbia can appreciate... It's a good

 neighbor. You know, the kind that helps with the last bag of

 groceries... or brings over misplaced mail... or offers to mow your lawn.

 Yes, everyone appreciates a good neighbor. You are so sweet to do

 this. I just know how tricky these bulbs can be. And no

 one knew this better than Dave Williams, who was determined to be

 the best neighbor Wisteria Lane had ever seen... assuming, of course, his

 wife didn't get in the way. - What's going on? - Packing

 our bags. Karen McCluskey insulted me again, and I can't put up

 with it anymore. All right, what did she say to you this

 time? Nothing. It doesn't matter. We are moving. Adults don't pack up

 and move because of some good-natured teasing. She said that my breasts

 were a triumph of German engineering. You call that good-natured? Come on.

 She's a cranky old lady. It's not just her. It's all of

 them. I mean, it's been five years. I have changed. But the

 people on this street don't care. To them, I will always be

 a joke. I'm sorry you had a bad day. Please don't use

 your motivational voice. - I really hate that. - You're upset... and

 you're tired. Why don't you take a nice hot shower, and I'll

 make us some lunch? Does that sound good? I just never understood

 it. We... we could've gone and lived in any city in this

 country. Why did you insist on living here? 'Cause we can be

 happy here. You just need to give it some time. And I

 promise, I'll personally see to it that people start treating you with

 a little more respect. You didn't answer my question. Didn't I? Carlos,

 we got invited to Michelle Downing's party! I'm gonna have to buy

 something nice to... aah! Gaby, I'm giving a massage. I can see

 that. I can see a lot of things... things that can never

 be unseen. Sorry. I guess the towel must've rode up. Carlos? Kitchen.

 Now. I know you don't like it when I work down here,

 but he couldn't get up the stairs. He's got a bum hip.

 He's also missing a testicle. Carlos, how much more of this am

 I supposed to take? Okay, maybe I could set up my table

 in the garage. No! That's only part of the problem. Have you

 checked our bank balance lately? Gaby, I am not taking the country

 club job. Why not? You'd be massaging rich people. They tip better

 and they tend to flake less. Yeah, but I like working here.

 I get to spend lots of time with you and the kids.

 Carlos, I don't need to spend lots of time with you. And

 frankly, the kids are on the fence. Bottom line, I miss our

 life. I miss shopping. All I have to look forward to is

 the occasional invitation to a fancy party. And I can't even afford

 a dress to go to it. Carlos, please, I am begging you.

 Fine. I'll... I will take the job. Thank you. Sorry. Ah, no.

 Come on. I really don't think Mike's gonna care what shirt I

 wear. Well, I do. We need a shirt that says, \"I'm a

 responsible citizen,\" not \"my favorite clothing store also sells bongs.\" Are you

 dissing my sense of style? Absolutely. Put this on. Now... let's talk

 about acceptable topics of conversation. - You like sports, right? - Yeah.

 - I'm a huge soccer fan. - No, you're not. You like

 football... american football. - Specifically the colts. - Okay. And here are

 some other things you can talk about : cars, barbue, fishing. How

 about fire? Mike like talk fire? Jackson, please take this seriously. I

 am. I'm just... I'm not gonna pretend to be somebody I'm not.

 If he doesn't like me, wh's he gonna do? He could take

 me to court, and the judge can make me choose between you

 and my son. And I'm sorry. You will lose. Peyton Manning is

 the greatest quarterback who ever lived. Thank you. Now go shave. You

 look like a hobo. Got a sec? Not really. So I assume

 you know about what happened to Jimmy Conrado. I guess. Your friend

 gets busted for dealing drugs at school, and all you have to

 say is, \"I guess\"? He's not my friend. What are you talking

 about? You were on the same little league team. Yeah, like a

 million years ago. Anything else? No. Not really. Parker. Can I ask

 you something... just between us? Does Porter hang out with Jimmy Conrado?

 I don't know. I could check out his friends list on Silverfizz.

 His what on what? It's like myspace. You have a web page.

 It shows your hobbies, your favorite music, and you can talk to

 people. Really? Can anyone talk to him? Yeah. He just has to

 invite you. And, uh... how would somebody make that happen? Now it's

 just a mock-up, but this is what the book is going to

 look like. Mom, that's fantastic. Good call on the font. Thank you,

 dear. Orson, what do you think? Well, I think it's strange to

 see my wife billed as \"Mrs. Van De Kamp.\" Well, you knew

 what the book was gonna be called. Yes, but it's differen actually

 seeing it. I mean, is it too late to go with \"Mrs.

 Hodge\"? My company, which I formed when we were separated, is called

 Mrs. Van De Kamp's catering. It's how I'm known. Oh, in Fairview.

 But this book will be national. I mean, it's your chance to

 rebrand yourself. Is there something wrong with \"Hodge\"? I think I just

 heard the milk go bad. I should check. Orson, I adore you,

 but your name... our name... it has no music. \"Van De Kamp\"

 trips off the tongue. \"Hodge\" sounds like the noise a plunger makes.

 - That's preposterous. - Listen. Van De Kamp. Hodge. Also, she's got

 a radio interview wednesday, and they're already promoting her as Mrs. Van

 De Kamp. See? The ship has already sailed. Oh, don't be hurt.

 It's my professional name. In this house, I will always be Mrs.

 Hodge. Now... would it help if Mrs. Hodge cooked you your favorite

 pot roast tonight? Yes, I guess it would help. Meeting with your

 publicist? Oh, right. Um... tomorrow for sure, then. Van De Kamp. Hodge.

 - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. Toby, get off my

 chair. You know better. So what's on your mind? It's Edie. You

 said something to her yesterday that hurt her feelings. That thing about

 her breasts? Come on. That was a joke. Perhaps. But it upset

 her so much that she suggested we leave Wisteria Lane. I can't

 have that, Mrs. M. Hey, this is what Edie and I do.

 We tease each other. I say she's easier to get into than

 community college. She says my face looks like a knee. It's fun.

 Still... I would consider it a personal favor if you'd apologize to

 her. You know, make her feel accepted... and loved. No. No? If

 Edie wants to change the way we talk to each other, she's

 gotta ask me personally. And I think you've got a lot of

 gall making me feel like I did something wrong when you don't

 even know me. I know you, better than you think. Oh, really?

 For starters, you talk to your cat like it's a person. When

 I knocked on your door, you immediately invited me in. Doesn't take

 a genius to see that, you're lonely. I'm thinking you had people

 in your life at one time... people who cared about you. But

 something happened to them. Some probably died. The rest, well... they just

 don't come around much anymore. Why do you think that is? I

 know you, Mrs. McCluskey. And it seems to me that a woman

 like you would like to keep the few friends that she has

 left. I think you'd better go. Thanks for tonight. And, uh, before

 I forget, the Colts suck. Here's what sucks, watching a zero-zero game

 with no cheerleaders, soccer boy. You guys were insulting each other. That's

 good, right? We had a blast. Really? In fact, we're getting together

 wednesday night at O'Brien's, which he claims has the best bacon potato

 skins in town. Potato skins at O'Brien's? You've made his inner circle!

 This is fantastic! Thank you. Ah, you can think of a more

 creative way to thank me than that. Nice. You've never done that

 before. Wait. You've never done that before. Why are you doing that

 now? I don't know. Don't you like it? Yeah. But how did

 you know I would like it? - Oh, my God. - What?

 Mike told you about the ear thing, didn't he? No. So you

 just happened to stumble across my secret turn-on the same night that

 you and Mike became B.F.F.S? But aren't we losing sight of the

 fact that you like it? This is... I mean, I'm just... I

 have been violated. - Oh, honey, come on... - Don't touch me!

 Or my ears! - My ears are dead to you. - It

 just slipped out. We were talking about how girls, they all like

 different things, right? And I was talking about this girl in high

 school, how she liked to do it with her shoes on, and

 Mike talked about the lobe nibble. He has a name for it?

 Okay. That's it. You and Mike are not hanging out anymore. And

 this little wednesday \"potato skins and Susan sex tips night\"? I forbid

 it. Did Mike mention he likes having his toes sucked? Oops, that

 just slipped out. Gaby... Bree! What's up? Well, um, Michelle Downing asked

 me to speak to you. I don't know if you heard, but

 I'm catering her birthday party... I heard. I can't wait. I was

 gonna ask you. Should I wear the navy blue chanel or -

 the red sleeveless dress? - You can't come. Sorry. I just had

 to rip the band-aid off. What? - She's disinviting me? - It's

 not personal. You know how Carlos just started at the club? Well,

 her guests are all members, and she thinks they might find it

 awkward socializing with... staff. She called us \"staff\"? Oh, Gaby, it's just

 one party. I'll save you some cake. No! It's not just one

 party! It's the kickoff to the whole social season. If people see

 we're off Michelle's list, then we'll be off everyone's. And then it's

 gonna be the start of our slow slide from gowns and galas

 to flip-flops and keggers! Okay, if Carlos working at the club is

 the problem, then tell her he just quit. Oh, hon, I don't

 think that's gonna fly. He's already rubbed too many members. What's happened

 to my life? We used to have help. Now we are the

 help! What are you doing? I am just... talking to Porter on

 Silverfizz. Who is Sara J from MacArthur high school? Me. I'm 16

 and cute. I like graphic novels and Tokyo police club. Oh, my

 God. You're pretending to be somebody else? Our brooding son has a

 classmate who got arrested for selling drugs. I really think the end

 justifies the means here. Okay, we'll address your major ethical breach in

 a moment. What did you find out? Well, the good news is

 he really doesn't hang out with Jimmy Conrado. But I am a

 little worried about Anita47, who told him cherry fruit pops are an

 aphrodisiac. Okay, great, you know who he hangs around with now. You

 got what you came for. Time to stop. You're probably right. It's

 just... did you know Porter writes poetry? - Serious? - Yeah. Our

 Porter, the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs, writes this... beautiful,

 heart-wrenching poetry. Maybe one day he'll share it with you instead of

 your fantasy alter ego. Until then, shut it off. Okay, okay. You're

 right. You're right. I luvs me some Walt Whitman! Emily Dickinson kicks

 Walt Whitman's ass!! Yeah, if you're into spinster poetry. oh, really? Is

 your girlfriend into peotry, too? Don't have one. There's a girl I

 like. But we haven't gotten to that yet. That's sweet. Girls love

 romance. Send her a poem. She won't know what hit her. Still

 talking to poetry girl? Bite me. Dude, she didn't put up her

 photo. 5 bucks says she looks like she came out of an

 egg. Whatever. Toby? Toby! Where are you? Toby! Everything all right, Mrs.

 M. It's Toby. I can't find him. Oh, no. How did he

 get out? The living room window was open, which is bizarre 'cause

 I don't remember opening it. Can you help me find him? Have

 you given any more thought about apologizing to Edie? She's still pretty

 down in the dumps. I've kind of been busy. Of course you

 have. It's just that... well, since I'm about to help you find

 your cat, it sure would be nice if you could help me

 out with Edie. Doesn't that seem fair to you? I guess. Here.

 Thank you. Toby! Toby! Come here, boy! Toby! So they'll finish with

 the news, do a quick traffic update, and then we're on the

 air. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm good. How do

 I look? We're on the radio. I'm a little bit nervous. This

 is my first national interview. And I am a huge fan of

 your cookbooks. Well, I've heard good things about you. I understand you're

 catering Michelle Downing's birthday dinner tonight. Oh, you know Michelle? Yes, and

 I'll be there. I can't wait to see what you dish up.

 Okay, now I'm terrified. Here we go. Good afternoon. I'm Linda Flanagan,

 and this is \"Gourmet Americana.\" If you've been to Fairview's best parties,

 then you've probably tasted the mouthwatering food dished up by my first

 guest, Bree Van De Kamp. Now she's about to publish her first

 book, \"Mrs. Van De Kamp's old-fashioned cooking.\" - Welcome, Bree. - Hi,

 Linda. Tell me. Why \"old-fashioned\"? Well, I think a lot of people

 miss the way life used to be... back when women had more

 time to cook. It's always been important to me to have the

 family gather around the table every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals.

 So you're a traditional kinda gal. Is there a Mr. Van De

 Kamp? No. Uh, Mr. Van De Kamp is deceased. But in regards

 to my husband, I should make one thing very clear... his passing

 had nothing to do with my cooking. Is that my Yeats book?

 I love his poetry. Yeah. I'm borrowing it for school. This is

 the kind of poetry that melts a girl's heart. So romantic. Here's

 a great one-- \"The lover tells of the rose in his heart.\"

 My first boyfriend gave me this poem. I was a junior in...

 Mom, I'm... I'm running late. Can I have the book back? Sorry.

 Enjoy! Katherine, it is not too late to change tonight's menu. If

 Linda Flanagan likes my food, she might give me a quote for

 the book jacket. I have to knock her socks off, and I

 am not betting the farm on Haddock. Argue with me all you

 like. I just bought 40 pounds of pork, so get your tushie

 over here. Orson! Did you get my message about Linda Flanagan? Yes,

 I heard. Isn't it amazing? Almost as amazing as my on-air death

 notice. What? \"So, Bree, do you have a husband?\" \"Nope. Used to.

 He croaked.\" She didn't ask if I had a husband. She asked

 if there was a Mr. Van De Kamp, and there's clearly not.

 Well, there's a Mr. Hodge. Would it have killed you to have

 mentioned me? And waste valuable airtime? The show was about my cookbook,

 not about my tortured marital history. That's not what this is about.

 It's because I went to jail, isn't it? Orson, I have 6

 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people. We're not having this

 discussion now. Just admit it. You're ashamed of me. Should I be

 proud? Do you want me to go on the radio and boast

 that my husband served time for running someone over? I went to

 jail because you told me it was the only way you'd take

 me back. And because it was the right thing to do. I

 just didn't know then that I would be a public figure someday.

 But I am. I have a name now. And luckily for you,

 it's not mine. Orson, please don't be hurt. I am under so

 much pressure and so terrified I'll fail that I don't even know

 what I'm saying half the time. Just let me get through this.

 As soon as the plates go out tonight, I will come home

 and cook you that pot roast I promised. Okay? Okay. It's just

 that... I-- Chives! How could I forget chives? Hey, Susan, it's me.

 Listen, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight. My college

 roommate's in town, and this is the only night we can get

 together. Is his name Mike Delfino? Did you room together at liars'

 college? I know it's last-minute, and I'm really sorry, but I still

 wanna see you. So how about I drop by later? Call me

 if that's a problem. Yeah, you'll drop by later... with potato skins

 on your breath, you miserable two-timer! What's wrong, mom? Nothing. Just, the

 answering machine lied to mommy. I finally found a poem as beautiful

 as you. You're all I think about \"The Lover Tells Of The

 Rose In His Heart\" by William Butler Yeats Oh, crap on things.

 Crap on what things? Porter sent me a sex poem. What? Why?

 He may be in love with me. Why would he be in

 love with you? Okay... remember how you told me I should stop

 talking to him online? Well, of course, I didn't, and I sort

 of told him I liked his poetry. You told a teenage boy

 that you liked his poetry? Jeez, Lynette! Why not just flash him

 a boob? He'll hear you. So what are you gonna do? Are

 you gonna tell him the truth now, or are you gonna wait

 until after he kills me and blinds himself? Calm down. I'm gonna

 break it off in an e-mail. Oh, great. Just like that? That'll

 kill him. I know that you have only been the receiving end

 of break-up letters, but I've actually written a few,and I know how

 to let him down easy. \"Dear Porter, I really like you, but

 I wanna see other offspring.\" Go away. You know, I'm kinda surprised

 we still made Michelle's list this year, what with me working at

 the club. Oh, don't be silly, Carlos. We're still on everyone's list.

 - Now let's go. - Okay. Gaby, are we in the banquet

 hall? What's all the noise? Oh, it's just the caterers putting glasses

 and silverware on the tables. They make some racket, huh? But the

 decorations are stunning. Especially that waterfall effect. Gaby? Bree! Shouldn't you be

 in the kitchen? Don't move, honey. The press is taking your photo.

 What are you doing here? You were disinvited. I got it all

 figured out. We duck inside, make sure we're seen by all the

 right people, except Mrs. Downing, and then after about 20 minutes, we

 cut out. Well, I know nothing. Just keep me out of it.

 What is Carlos doing? Where is he? Where is who? Like you

 don't know... Jackson. Well, he's not here. Really? Whose is this? I...

 I don't know. Some guy's. \"I...I don't know\"? Well, I hope that

 \"some guy\", doesn't mind this. No, Susan, really, I wouldn't... Lady, what

 are you doing to my beer? We're not married anymore, so I

 don't have to protect you. I am... so sorry. Miss? Could you

 just... please take good care of my friend? Jackson canceled on me.

 He said you weren't comfortable with us hanging out. He said that?

 And I think I said, \"meow.\" I am such a jackass. So

 why don't you want us hanging out? Well, I was pretty ticked

 off that you told Jackson about the ear thing. Oh, God. The

 second I said that, I wished I hadn't. I'm really sorry. Apology

 accepted. So if I promise to behave, can we still hang out?

 'Cause I really think it'd be good for M.J. Just seeing that

 we're all friends. I don't... What? I'm just not comfortable with you

 and Jackson getting that close. Okay. It's just... I don't want him

 to see me through your eyes. How exactly do you think I

 see you? Well, those last few months we were together, I... the

 things I said to you, the way I acted... I mean, I'm

 not proud of the person I became. That was a bad time,

 Susan. We're not those people anymore. And if you could see yourself

 through my eyes, you'd know you got nothing to worry about. Could

 you please take care of this guy? He's my friend, too. Boy,

 am I glad to see you. Where you been? Out, doing some

 thinking. And I've decided that I may have gone a little overboard

 about you and Mike. In fact, I think it's cool if you

 wanna hang out with my ex. Hey, Susie Q. Just shakin' the

 dew off the lily. And speaking of, that paint job in the

 guest can is nice. Kudos. What are you doing here? Well, Julie

 needed me to cosign some insurance stuff for her, and I guess

 I lost track of time talking to crunchy granola here. Plumber to

 housepainter in one move, Susie? Don't get dizzy climbin' that social ladder.

 - Can you leave, please? - Just think... If I'd been a

 roofer, we might still be together. - Sigh. - Get out. See

 ya around, hacky sack. So... Any more exes I should know about?

 Don't you just love Michelle's parties? They are fun. But I enjoy

 my intimate lunches with Michelle even more. We have intimate lunches. We're

 friends. You simply must come to the charity auction at Ted's gallery

 next weekend. Really? We'd love to. Well, it's the caterer! Everything is

 fabulous. But would you be a dear and get me some more

 wine? I would be happy to. I just want to make sure

 it's the kind you like. You're still here? Dinner is about to

 be served. Whose seats are you in? The Bowmans. I found out

 Mrs. Bowman is home with the flu. Score! Oh, will you unclench?

 It'll be fine. These are my seats. This is my mother. That

 was Mr. Bowman, wasn't it? Yes, and I'm pretty sure that elderly

 woman with him was his mother! What kind of man leaves his

 sick wife at home to go party with mommy? You can fix

 this. Tell them you're at the wrong table and slip out the

 side door. Yes, sir, he has absolutely no... - Was it the

 maître d'? - He's checking the guest list. Which we're not on.

 You can fix this. Explain you're going to a different party here

 at the club and that you got confused. Mrs. Downing never has

 to know. You need to leave! Out. That's Mrs. Downing. How am

 I gonna fix this? At this point, I would just run off

 screaming into the night. Thank you. Get your hands off me. Poor

 blind bastard. I'll meet him outside. - What? - Hi, Edie. I

 just wanted to say I feel awful about what I said to

 you. You know, that crack I made the other day? Okay. That's

 nice of you. Are you all right? Actually, no. My cat's missing.

 Toby? Since when? It's been two days, and he's never been out

 this long. I'm so sorry. I'm sure he's fine. Yeah. Well... Could

 you tell Dave... Tell him I apologized? And you and I are

 good, huh? I guess I could. - Why do you want him...

 - Just tell him, please. I cannot believe you pulled a stunt

 like that. What? I was just trying to salvage what's left of

 our social life. Now just let it go and start thinking about

 where we're gonna move. This is not a joke, Gaby. I work

 with these people. I have to show my face tomorrow. - It's

 humiliating. - You wanna know what's humiliating? Waking up one day and

 finding out you're invisible. Now it's official. I've lost everything. Everything? First

 our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social

 standing. We haven't lost a thing except the chance to hobnob with

 a bunch of unhappy snobs. What do you mean, they're unhappy? They're

 rich! They have jewels and cooks. They use \"winter\" as a verb.

 I rub them, Gaby, and there is nothing that a blind masseur

 doesn't hear about. Trust me. They are every bit as miserable as

 I was when I was out there chasing that stuff. We have

 lost nothing that matters. We have a home, we have each other,

 we have work that supports us, and we have two beautiful little

 girls that... love us more than ice cream. I've never been happier

 in my life. Are you serious? Yes, and the only thing that

 would make me happier is for you to realize how good we've

 got it. \"I have never talked to such a wonderful guy, \"but

 I should've told you I'm already seeing somebody...\" \"Continue to trust your

 heart, and your dreams will follow.\" Best dear John letter ever. Thanks.

 Except you might wanna change that part where you signed it \"Love,

 Mom.\" What? No I didn't. Yeah, you did... Right there. You sent

 it? Oh, my God! - Why didn't you say something? - I

 did! You said it was great. Way to bury the lead, Tom!

 Tom, don't you dare! One of us needs to live to take

 care of the other one. God. Mind if I join you? Okay,

 I know what I did... was unforgivable. And I am not trying

 to make excuses, but... We used to talk all the time, and

 then one day it just stopped, and it killed me. I felt

 like I lost you. And then I was SaraJ, and I had

 you back, and we were talking again, and you were telling me

 things. I wasn't telling you anything. I was telling her. Okay. Well,

 for what it's worth, I loved our conversations, and I'm... going to

 miss them. Me, too. Orson, you're still up. I wish you could've

 been there. Linda Flanagan loved my food. She said I was \"God's

 gift to the table\" and that I could quote her on the

 book jacket. Are you all right? I'm hungry. It's after midnight. Haven't

 you eaten? I was waiting for you. You said you'd make me

 pot roast. I am so sorry. I lost all track of time,

 and Linda had so many questions about the food. I'll make you

 that pot roast tomorrow, okay? I want it now. Now? You promised.

 Orson, I've been cooking all day. I'm so tired, I can barely

 stand up. You really want me to make you a pot roast

 now? You promised. Toby! Where in the world did you come from,

 huh? Yes, everyone appreciates a good neighbor... You know, the kind that

 helps you with the groceries... but doesn't ask, \"Why is your son

 so moody?\" The type that delivers misplaced mail... but doesn't point out

 your wife seems discontented... The sort that offers to mow your lawn...

 but doesn't mention your husband seems cold. But if you're not sure

 the man next door is as nice as he would have you

 believe... Now why would you bring me flowers? 'Cause you've got a

 computer, and I need to find out some stuff about Edie's husband.
