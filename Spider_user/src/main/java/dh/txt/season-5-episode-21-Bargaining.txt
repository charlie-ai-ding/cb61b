 the way we are? Jackson left. Orson's lying to magain. Bree made

 a decision. So I think I have to divorce him. Karl signed

 up. Karl, what are you doing here? Well, I just enrolled evan.

 And susan confessed. Mike and I got in a car accident. Mike

 was driving, right? That's what we said, but it wasn't true. He

 took the blame for me. on this street, the bargaining begins at

 sunrise... an old woman offers a paperboy a generous tip if he'll

 throw the paper onto her porch... a wife tells her husband she'll

 make his favorite dinner if he'll bring home roses... a man tells

 his neighbor he'll take in his garbage cans the day she finally

 mows her lawn. Yes, on wisteria lane, everyone knows how to bargain--

 absolutely everyone. I don't want oatmeal. Can I have pancakes? Katherine's not

 a short order cook, buddy. If she made oatmeal for breakfast, we're

 having oatmeal. I tell you what, M.J. If you finish just half

 of it, I will make candied apples for your sleepover. I love

 candy apples. She's letting you off easy. You should thank her. Thank

 you, katherine. You are so welcome, you sweet thing. Dad, are you

 gonna marry katherine? that's, um... I don't know. Why not? Oh, well,

 oh, because we haven't talked about marriage. Why not? M.J., You're being

 rude. Oh, I'm not offended. Don't you wanna marry katherine? well... I

 love her. She's absolutely fantastic. So why don't you marry her? Can

 you help me out here? Are you kidding? Buddy, um, when it

 comes to marriage, the truth is... Would you look at the time?

 I'm late for work. we're gonna have to talk about this later.

 - Coward. - You got that right. How'd I do? You were

 great. But he didn't answer me. Doesn't matter. Issue's on the table.

 Yes, on this street, the negotiating begins at sunrise, and it doesn't

 Episode21 Walter bergen was a divorce lawyer, and the women who hired

 him always had something to say about the men they were divorcing.

 He's always talking to his grandmother, who died six years ago. He

 spends all his money on hookers, who may or may not be

 women. He says he needs more money for the children, and by

 \"children,\" I mean racehorses. Yes, walter bergen thought he had heard it

 all until the day when one ofis clients actually said... my husband

 is a decent man, and I want to do right by him.

 Women who seek my services rarely take that attitude. Well, I like

 to think of myself as a good person. I'm sure you are.

 And I wouldn't worry about your husband. The income he'll derive from

 his half of the catering business alone should-- wait.I'm not planning on

 giving him half. It's my business. Which you started after you were

 married. That entitles him to half. I-I may have overstated things when

 I described my husband as a decent man. He actually has a

 wide variety of psychological problems. Mrs. Hodge, it's state law. What do

 you want me to say? I want you to say that for

 $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to

 help me protect my business. Surely you're not asking me to do

 something criminal? Mrs. Hodge, didn't you say you like to think of

 yourself as a good person? Well, clearly, I like to think of

 myself as a rich person even more. Full house. Bree takes the

 high. Gaby gets the low. Split the pot. Oh, I hate splitting

 the pot. Well, that's the rule. There's nothing you can do about

 it. So stop bitching. Well, you can't talk to me like that.

 I am the wife of fairview's latino businessman of the year. -

 So he finally won? - yeah. There's gonna be a huge dinner,

 and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife. Oh,

 not necessarily. I hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly.

 really? How do you know? The wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical

 divorce lawyer in town. Who--who's that? My ex-husband. Oh, right. Karl's a

 divorce lawyer. Yeah, and a total shark. The worst thing about our

 divorce was that I couldn't hire him to represent me. But I

 thought you just split everything done the middle. Oh, not with karl.

 By the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing

 left to split. You don't say. Hey, ladies. Uh, lynette, ahem. It's

 getting kinda late. Are you kicking us out, tom? Uh, no. No,

 just reminding lynette that it's, uh, ten minutes till midnight, which means

 ten minutes till tomorrow. I got it. I'll be right up. What

 was that about? Tom and I are reading this book that suggests

 couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.

 Let me guess. Written by a guy? Was his name carlos solis?

 we've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy

 and brings you closer. Is it working? I've gotta say it is.

 You become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to--

 - lynette! - Je! Two seconds! We--we should go. No, we're in

 our third week. We got this down to a science. Just deal

 me out a few hands. juanita, hurry up. The bus will be

 here any minute. Be right down! There's an extra piece of cinnamon

 toast on the table. Not hungry. Bye! susan? It's dave. Hey, remember

 I was telling you about my buddy that owns that boat on

 bass lake? Yeah, well, he's not using it this weekend, so I

 thought maybe I'd take you and M.J.Fishing. Yeah, I know it's short

 notice, but I really wanted to do something to thank you. You've

 been so good to me since edie died. Plus I know M.J.Would

 love it. Great. I'm really looking forward to it. Bye. CH**** hello?

 Oh, hi, principal hardy. What's up? She's wearing what? Now march in

 there and wipe that stuff off! - You don't have to yell.

 - Yes, I do. Do you have any idea how humiliating it

 was for me to get that call today? Now every parent in

 town is gonna think that I let my 6-year-old wear makeup to

 school! And I want my makeup back. Is it in here? why

 do you have this? Juanita. ****** why? Some girls at school saw

 you pick me up yesterday and told me I must be adopted.

 They said I wasn't pretty enough to be your daughter. how's it

 feeling? I-it's really throbbing. - Oh, please hurry. - Okay. hi there.

 Jackson, hey. You're back. I needed to talk to you. Why didn't

 you call? I wanted to surprise you. Well, you did. Oh, uh,

 right. Jackson, you remember mrs. Mccluskey, don't you? Sure. How are you,

 mrs. Mccluskey? Oh, I'm in agonizing pain. Thanks for asking. I'm taking

 her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure. He's

 gonna lance a boil on my backside. It may rupture any second.

 Okay. I just had my car detailed, so I should probably go.

 No problem. Uh, when can I see you? how about dinner tomorrow

 night? Sounds great. If you t want to keep staring at each

 other, I can just go lay down on the lawn and die.

 I don't mind. Ll see you tomorrow. - karl. - Hey, mike.

 Heard M.J.'S having a sleepover. I thought I'd hit you up for

 an invitation. Aren't you a little old for sleepovers? Cards on the

 table. I need your help. Evan's one of the only boys in

 class who wasn't invited, and he's really upset. Okay, cards on the

 table. M.J.Says evan's a bully, and he doesn't want him at his

 sleepover. Well, what if I promise evan will be on his best

 behavior? I'm sorry. It's out of my hands. M.J.Finalized his guest list.

 Well, I think if you check that list again, you'll notice evan's

 name's on there. I'm M.J.'S dad, not his bouncer. But... thanks. Hey,

 honey. How's your day going? Very exciting. Just got back from the

 grocery store. It is double coupon day, sorta like the oscars and

 the super bowl all rolled into one. did you remember to get

 my, um... my special deodorant? I sure did. milady's armpits will be

 aluminum-free. How is your day? I'm totally slammed, which is why I'm

 calling. It looks like I'm gonna be here late tonight, and by

 \"late,\" I mean past midnight. Wait. W-what about our pact? We'll... double

 up tomorrow. Lynette, I have been looking forward to this all day.

 I know, and I'm really sorry. Listen, I gotta go. I will

 call you later. I love you. Bye. tom. What are you doing

 here? Is everything all right? Everything's fine. Well, then what are you

 doing... here? oh, no. Are you crazy? Crazy about you, baby. But

 I have so much to do, and I'm not gonna be done

 till 2:00 A.M. - Possibly 3:00. - Come on. This is important.

 Remember what the book said? Every night, no matter what. no, this

 is a really bad time for me. Well, you did buy me

 that deodorant. lynette, I have carlos on line two. Uh, tell him

 I'll call right back. He says it's really important. Hello? Hey, lynette.

 I'm over here at capital consultants, and the guys have a question.

 I need you to pull up their account. Now? I'm kind of

 busy! Well, the ad has to be at the printer's by noon,

 so yeah, now. lynette? Lynette! Yes? What's going on? You all right?

 Sorry. Just had the handyman in here, but he's finished. Thank you,

 handyman. you're welcome, ma'am. So... carlos... where were we? Could I get

 you something? No, thanks, I don't drink. Oh, that's right. Glug glug.

 I remember now. I'm bringing you business, karl. Try not to insult

 me. Sorry. So you want to divorce orson. Yes, I know that

 comes as a surprise. Not really. I've met him. The guy's a

 stiff. Karl, if we move forward, I will insist you handle our

 divorce with dignity. are you sure? I don't know of a dignified

 way to screw a spouse out of money that they, by law,

 are entitled to. That is why you're hiring me, right? I just

 want to protect what is rightfully mine. Can you help me? -

 sure. - Lovely. I'll make out a check. Yeah, not so fast.

 Uh, I said i could do it, not that i would. I

 need a favor. Well, what kind of a favor? M.J. Delfino is

 having a sleepover at his house in two days. My son wasn't

 invited. Now his feelings are hurt. So? So I want you to

 get my son into that sleepover. How would I go about doing

 that? Gosh, I don't know. How would I go about hiding your

 assets from orson? I need your help, karl. I really do, but

 I am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old. You know, I had this

 one client... his wife had been with him since junior high. She

 supported him through med school, gave him three kids and the best

 years of her life. Once I had done my particular brand of

 legal magic, he ended up with 90% of the money, and she

 ended up in a studio apartment... with a roommate. Then again... M.J.

 Does... love my macaroons. sweetie, don't listen to those kids. They're idiots.

 You are a gorgeous little girl. You have to say that. You're

 my dad. No, it's the truth. You are naturally beautiful. Makeup just

 covers that up. He's right, sweetie. You don't need all that gunk

 on your face. Then why do you wear it? Because I'm an

 adult. And besides, I hardly wear any. Come on, gaby. Let's try

 to keep this real. Are you gonna wear makeup when daddy gets

 his big award? Well, it's a big, fancy dinner. Of course. But

 that's not fair. Sweetie, you're 6. There's a lot of things I

 can do that you don'T. So you get to look pretty at

 daddy's party, and i have to look like this? Hey, I have

 a great idea. Okay, see? Your daddy's got a great idea. How

 about if neither one of you wears makeup to the dinner? Okay.

 no, no, no. Your daddy's just being silly. Can I talk to

 you for a second, silly daddy? are you a lunatic? I am

 not walking into a ballroom full of people without my face on.

 Come on. This is the perfect opportunity to teach her that beauty's

 only skin deep. Yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation,

 you may want to rethink that. Gaby, your daughter is in pain.

 And don't you love her enough to put your vanity aside for

 one night? I was in labor for 20 hours. She still owes

 me for that! fine. I will make the ultimate sacrifice, and I

 will be ugly for my daughter. But if she ever needs a

 kidney... You're really going all out on this sleepover. although I'm not

 sure that tons of sugar and whistles are a good combination. Oh,

 good point. I'll make us some goody bags filled with earplugs and

 vodka. It's great. I'm sure M.J.Will appreciate it. I'm sure he will.

 He's a great K... and funny. that was hilarious the other day,

 when he asked us when we're getting married. I'm glad you thought

 it was funny. I was tap-dancing my ass off. No, you were

 great. Although... someday you'll probably have to answer the question. I'm sure

 he's forgotten by now. You know kids. Kids are like that. Grown-ups

 on the other hand... not so much. We're not talking about M.J.

 Ymore, are we? Oh, you want to go run and get your

 tap shoes? No. No. I'll be completely honest here. Moving in with

 you is one of the best decisions I ever made. you make

 me really, really happy. But? I've been married before, and I just

 don't see myself getting married again. Okay. Probably not what you wanted

 to hear. I wanted the truth. It's not your fault the truth

 sucks. So could you get the streamers out of the car? Sure.

 Oh, by the way, for what it's worth, I do love you.

 I've only been working there two months, but I love it. And

 the kids are so cute. And I get to see M.J. During

 the day, which is nice. Uh, you kn, uh, for a guy

 that just had to see me so bad, you... you seem awfully

 far away. I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. I have something...

 to ask you, and I don't know how you're gonna react. What

 is it? This is gonna come out of nowhere, but... I want

 you to marry me. A-and here's how I came to this. The

 other day... what are you doing? I have to go upstairs. Now?

 susan, are you okay? I'm fine. I just didn't want you to

 see me crying. Honey, you didn't let me finish. Oh, I'm sorry.

 Just, um, all I've been telling myself that I didn't really care

 about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly.

 But I am so lonely. And as much as I tell myself

 that i like being the strong, single woman on her own, the

 truth is, I think about you all the time. And I wanted

 to call you, but I thought you'd gotten over me. And to

 hear that you still love me... that is just something that I

 really needed to hear right now. And I want you to know--

 oh, god. I want you to know I love you, too. Jackson...

 I love you. jackson? Oh,god. I really wish you'd let me finish.

 Finish what? Susan,I need you to marry me so that immigration doesn't

 deport me back to canada. The one thing I didn't tell you

 is that I'm here on a student visa that expired six y

 and I got a call from the authorities,so unless I can find

 somebody that will marry me, I'm gonna be in really big trouble.

 Susan? Susan,did you hear me? I heard. So... what do you say?

 Okay. Okay,it was a bad idea. Get out or I will kick

 your ass back to the canadian border! took a shower,brushed my teeth.

 We are good to go. Lynette. What are you doing? You know,the

 pact. Didn't we already do it tonight? no. Oh,they're all starting to

 blur. look,I worked till 3:00 A.M.Last night. I'm exhausted. How about we

 take a rain check? A rain check? This isn't baseball. Every night

 for 30 days-- that's the law. Tom,I have a 7:00 A.M.Meeting. How

 about I take a long lunch,and you do me twice at work

 tomorrow? Come on. This is important. Okay. Okay. We'll have sex. But

 can you make it quick? Lynette,please. You can't rush an artist. Morning.

 Oh,sorry. I don't have time for breakfast. good. I didn't make you

 any. Oh,okay. Uh,coffee will be fine. Beans are right there. Grab a

 handful and grind. Is there a problem? You don't remember? Last night,we

 were having sex? You fell asleep? After? During. Was it good? I

 didn't finish. God,you ruined our streak,lynette. I'm sorry. I was exhausted. It's

 not like I was asking you to scrub a floor. All you

 had to do was lie there,like you usually do. Oh,okay. I'm gonna

 let that one go,'cause you're upset. Well,it's true. With you being so

 tired from work lately,I'm the one doing all the heavy lifting. Tom,you're

 being completely irrational. We've had sex 23 days straight. I've seen more

 ceilingthan michelangelo. We made a commitment,lynette. The book says-- oh,would you stop

 with the book? You bought it at a car wash along with

 a pack of gumand an air freshener. You're right. It's stupid. All

 my ideas are stupid. I should just stick to doing chores. Don't

 just walk away. You better get to work,lynette. You're gonna be late.

 Haven't seen you boys in a while. There's been a break in

 the club fire case,mr. Williams. You got a minute? do you know

 this guy? No. Who is he? Dr. Samuel heller,psychiatrist from boston. He's

 the guy who burned up in the fire. What's a shrink from

 boston doing in fairview? No idea,but we'd like to find out if

 anyone knows him or what he was doing there. Did you see

 him backstage? No,I didn't see anybody. Except porter scavo. Yeah,but I told

 you. That was a mistake. - Do you know a guy named

 jackson braddock? - Was he? Yeah,he got locked in the employee men's

 room right before the fire started. Well,I don't know anything about that.

 Have you talked to him? We've been trying,but he left town,and we've

 been unable to find him. That's a shame. We'll figure it out.

 Thanks for your time. You bet. hey,susan. It's dave. You know,I was

 thinking I'd pick up you and M.J.Around 6:00 A.M. Saturday for the

 trip. Yeah. I figured the earlier we get going,the better. Okay. well,hello

 there,M.J. I was baking this morning,and like an idiot,I made too many

 macaroons. Would you be willing to take one? I would hate to

 see them go to waste. Macaroons are my favorite. Oh,really? What a

 delightful coincidence. You know,I could bake these for you every week, and

 all I'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors. What

 kind of favor? Invite evan mayer to your sleepover. I don't like

 evan. He's mean. Oh,no. Deep down,he's just a fragile little boy who

 wants to be liked. He hit me with a dead squirrel. Now,M.J.,We

 can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick. What do

 you say? Will you invite him? Would you like some ice cream

 with your macaroons? Because I could make that happen. Bree? I'm late

 for my golf game. I don't have time to go to the

 A.T.M.,So I took the cash out of your wallet. Bye. M.J.,There's someone

 in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single

 day. And you are the only one who can help me. Please,please

 invite evan to your party. Okay. thank you. Oh,thank you,sweetheart. Boy,the stuff

 I do for macaroons. go away! I-I don't want to talk to

 you. Come on. Let me in. Thanks,but I've reached my maximum allowance

 for humiliation this week. Listen,I'm sorry you thought it was a real

 proposal. I thought you knew I'd moved on. Maximum allowance exceeded. What

 do you want? I wanted to apologize. You have every righto be

 mad at mE. Oh,I'm not mad at you. You know,I'm just disappointed

 in myself. I was a little lonely and a little afraid and...

 I just did what I always do-- let some silly romantic fantasy

 take over. I didn't know you ill felt that way about me.

 I don'T. This isn't about you. Not really. And besides,you moved on.

 Well,I had to. You pushed me away. I had to... heal my

 heart and get over it. This--I mean,this is really the only thing

 you can do to stay here and do your work? Yeah. I'll

 help you. Really? Yeah. I'll do it. But that's it. No love,no

 sex,just... marriage. No sex? You want people to think this is a

 real marriage,don't you? gaby,come on. For god sakes,will you take those off?

 It's 8:00 at night. Oh,fine. As long as you don't mind people

 thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister. There's

 our man of honor. gaby,this is stephanie. She put this whole banquet

 together. Nice to meet you. You're probably wondering why I look like

 this. Excuse me? I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup

 so I can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside.

 I don't actually look this hideous. Okay. Will you please stop explaining

 yourself? I mean,it was bad enough when you did it with the

 valet. I can't help it. I don't want people thinking I condone

 this face. I'm gonna go find our table. Champagne? Oh,thank you. I'm

 not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup. gaby! Gotta go. come

 on,guys. No running in the house. These candy apples are great. Can

 me and evan have another one? Well,I better ask katherine. Where is

 katherine? You're missing all the fun. I just got a candied apple

 out of a kid's hair. Sounds like you got everything under control.

 No,come on down. It's not as much fun without you. Okay. You

 were honest with me,so I'm gonna be honest with you. I got

 scared. Of what? I was hosting a party with this amazing man

 and his adorable son, and we were like the perfect family,anthen I

 realized... we're not a family. It could all go away in an

 instant. Katherine,I'm not leaving. But you're not committing either. Why not,mike? Is

 it susan? You still in love with her? No. No,I've told you

 that. Then it must be me. Katherine,I love ving you in my

 life. I'm just not ready. I don't know what else to say.

 I'm not trying to get you to say anything. I just have

 to take care of myself. I should probably go make sure the

 first floor is still there. Excuse me. The mayor's about to leave,and

 the newspaper wants a photo with him and your family. Oh,that's so

 sweet. tell him no way in hell. Tell him we'll be right

 there. The newspaper? Forget it. Gaby,I do business with the city. I

 can't just blow off the mayoR. Seriously,we cannot allow this to be

 photographed. Next time there's an epidemic,people are gonna think I'm patient zero.

 You're not getting out of this. Fine. But just so we're clear,you're

 also latino jerk of the year. Come on. Let's go. Oh,can I

 at least use the bathroom first? ladies! Attention,please. I am in a

 jam,and I need lipstick and eyeliner. Come on. Chop chop. You can

 use my makeup. Oh,that doesn't really go with my skin tone. What

 do yomean? We have the same coloring. Yeah,it doesn't really go with

 your skin tone either, but I can only deal with one disaster

 at a time. Asian girl. Close enough. Um,I don't think so. Was

 it the \"chop chop\" thing? Fine. I'm sorry. Now can I borrow

 some blush? I don't share cosmetics. I'm sort of a germ freak.

 Oh,don't worry. I'm as healthy as a horse. Really? You look sick.

 That's 'cause I don't have any makeup! I said no. Now leave

 me alone. Okay,okay,look. I'm sorry. You're right. I never should have asked.

 Come out now,or I'll call security! You know,for a woman who has

 a purse full of dinner rolls,you sure have a lot of attitude.

 Oh,good. We're all here. By the way,mrs. Solis,you look absolutely stunning. Thank

 you. Yeah,mom. You look great. Okay,big smiles,everyone. see this? My third espresso.

 I'm wired. No way I'm falling asleep tonight. How about we throw

 a pizza on the front lawn,and when the kids run out to

 get it, we lock the door and do it in every room

 in the house? Tom,I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.

 If you wanna stay mad,I guess you're gonna stay mad. I am

 not mad,lynette. Then what's wrong? You're gonna think it's stupid. Tell me.

 You want to know why sex has become so important to me

 lately? Because you are the only thing in my life that I'm

 passionate about. That is so sweet. No. No,it's not good,lynette-- not for

 me,not for you. I... I need something else to be excited about.

 I thought you wanted to do this,to take a break and stay

 home. I did. You know,I figured,the kids are grown... I can take

 care of the house and the errands,and it'll be easy,and it is.

 It's too damn easy. I am finished with my work by noon,and

 then I just sit around,waiting for you to come home. So... what

 do you want to do? What are you passionate about? I don't

 know. I'm a middle-aged guy,and I don't know what I want to

 do with my life. I told you it was stupid. No. No.

 I know I disappointed you tonight,and I'm really sorry. It's okay. I

 know why you did it. I need makeup,too. Honey,I know you think

 being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right

 now, but believe me,it's not. You were a model. yes,I was. And

 my whole life,people told me how pretty I was. So you know

 what? I never thought I had to work hard in school or

 work on friendships or my personality-- none of it. And then I

 stopped modeling,and I realized I didn't have much on the inside. And

 I don't want that for you. I want you to be brave

 and funny and creative... to be more than just a shell. I

 want you to have the whole rich,gooey center. Will you promise to

 do that for yourself? Okay. when do I get to wear makeup?

 I tell you what. You can wear makeup the day you realize

 you don't really need it. I bought M.J.A fishing pole. I figure

 I'd teach the little guy how to cast before we hit the

 water. Oh,my god. We're not gonna be able to make it this

 weekend. I'm kind oF... getting married. What? to who? dave williams. I

 thought I heard you out here. Jackson. just when you thought I

 was out of the picture,I'm back. since you held up your end

 othe bargain,I'm going to hold up mine. I'm gonna make sure that

 you walk away from this marriage with your business and your assets

 intact. Now to accomplish this,I may need you to lie,stonewall, even resort

 to some outright trickery. My question is... will you be up for

 that? I used to think of myself as a good person. If

 I had a choice,I would always choose the high road. Lately I've

 begun to realize that,um... I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be

 done. You know what that makes you? The perfect client. on this

 street,the bargaining is finished by sundown... a daughter agrees to go to

 bed early if her mother lets her dress up in her old

 gowns... a woman agrees to let her fianc? spend the night if

 he'll agree to sleep on the sofa... a man allows his lover

 to get close as long as they don't discuss the future. Yes,everyone

 knows how to bargain on wisteria lane... ***late *** ****morning ***tonight ***
