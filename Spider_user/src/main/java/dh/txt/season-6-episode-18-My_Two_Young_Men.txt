 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. Preston buy these for me in Paris. That woman

 is a gold digger. There was a shocking announcement. You proposed? She's

 the one. I know it. The other night was a mistake. A

 surprising move. Mr. Logan? A dangerous disclosure. I'll tell you where she

 lives when I get my $ 1,000. A stunning discovery. What are

 you doing with a picture of Rex? He was my father. And

 a welcoming embrace. You should never trust family photos. They are designed

 to be misleading. A mother's bright smile may hide a lifetime of

 disappointment. A son's sweet expression could conceal boundless rage. A daughter's sedate

 pose might obscure years of unladylike behavior. And as for that father

 with the air of dignity, there's always the chance he has another

 family elsewhere. - I... I don't know what to say. - Well,

 I'm not surprised. It's a shocking bit of news, to say the

 least. - So, you're my brother? - Half-brother, to be precise. I

 can't believe this. Andrew, you have every right to be upset. Your

 father should have told us about this years ago, but please don't

 be angry with Sam. It's not his fault. I'm fine. I just

 need to be by myself for a while. Of course. We understand.

 - If you don't mind, I'll hug you later. - Take your

 time. Well, he certainly handled that better than I expected. When the

 shock wears off, I think we'll end up good friends. And wait

 till you meet Danielle. Her flight comes in tomorrow and I just

 know the two of you are really gonna hit it off. Don't

 you agree, Orson? Uh, yes, I'm sure. Sam, would you mind locking

 up the test kitchen? Happy to. Again, thank you for everything. So,

 when did you speak to Danielle? An hour ago, and she was

 just as stunned as Andrew, but when I said I was gonna

 have a little dinner for Sam, she was determined to be here.

 Well, you've certainly wasted no time welcoming Sam to the family. Why

 not? That skeleton's been kept in the closet long enough. I understand.

 And I agree that Andrew and Danielle should try to make a

 connection to Sam. He's their blood relative. I'm just not sure why

 you're so excited by it. - Excited? I'm ashamed! - Ashamed? Rex

 kept that boy in the shadows for years. I can't look at

 Sam without feeling overwhelming guilt. - But you have nothing to feel

 guilty for. - It doesn't matter. Rex is gone, and someone needs

 to make it up to him. He is a Van De Kamp,

 and I'm gonna see to it that he is treated like one.

 Yes, be careful when looking at family photos. Like certain members of

 the family, they are not to be trusted. Every year, Oakridge Private

 School held a fundraising drive. Students were asked to sell $3 bars

 of chocolate. Whoever sold the most would receive a prize. Of course,

 for someone to win, someone else had to lose. Hey, MJ. Have

 you gone in and gotten your candy yet? - No. - Well,

 you better hurry up, 'cause I already saw some kids selling candy

 outside. - It doesn't matter. - Why not? 'Cause I'm not gonna

 win. I never win anything. You promised him he'd win? He was

 about to cry. What was I supposed to say? How about, \"If

 at first you don't succeed, try, try again\"? He tries all the

 time. He never wins anything. He's horrible at sports, he's lousy at

 card games, and let us not forget his humiliation at that spelling

 bee. Why did he think \"kayak\" had a Q in it? My

 point is that I want him to feel good about himself. Every

 child should win something at least once. See, you win everything. I

 know what it's like to lose. Dear God, not the jump-rope competition.

 It was sixth grade and there was a jump-rope competition. It was

 down to me and Barbara Briscoe. She had asthma and it was

 dandelion season and her eyes were swollen and she was jumping blind,

 until her mom gave her an antihistamine shot, which is technically a

 steroid, and she was juiced! So are you gonna be supportive or

 not? Yes, I will. If you promise to never tell that story

 again. Was good? If I had any government secrets, they'd be yours.

 Irina? I'm sorry, I need to get the laundry. Hold one second.

 I have yet to get decent. - Come in. - Thanks. Huh.

 I thought I made that bed this morning. I take nap. Feel

 much better. Yeah, I bet you do. Well, I will see you

 downstairs. Man, that was close. Crap. Your father and I told you,

 no sleeping together in this house, and here you are, openly defying

 us. Well, not openly. We were hoping to get away with it.

 That is not funny! Your 11-year-old sister is in the next room.

 I don't want you setting that kind of example. Dude, look out.

 Mom's back from the store. Oh. - This is what I was

 looking for. - I'd better get dressed. Preston! Preston! Get back here!

 I don't want a repeat of this, Irina. Do you understand? Why

 don't you just speak truth? I mean, if Preston was seeing another

 girl, you would not much care. You just don't like me. That

 is not true. I'm still getting to know you, and I am

 sure that, over time, I will come to think of you as

 a valued member of our... Here's what I was looking for. Well,

 you were right. That was more refreshing than taking a nap. I

 told you. - Honey. - Yeah? Don't dress in front of the

 window. I'm afraid of what your body could do to Roy's heart.

 Oops. - So, did you ever call him back? - Yeah, this

 morning. Mrs. McCluskey had her surgery and apparently she's cancer-free, so Roy's

 throwing a party to celebrate. That's so sweet! I hope you told

 him we'll be there. Can we talk about that? I told him

 we'd go, but I don't think we should go together. - What

 do you mean? - Well, it's just, except for Susan, people don't

 really know what's going on with us. Hey, you know what's funny?

 Neither do I. So, what is going on between us? I mean,

 are we friends with benefits, are we just dating, what? - Do

 we have to put a label on it? - No, I just...

 - I just want to know how you're feeling. - I really

 like you. That's how I feel. Can't that be enough for now?

 It could be. But it could also be pretty wonderful to let

 people know how happy we make each other. I don't know. Hey.

 I was right about the \"nap.\" Hello, ladies. Hide the booze. We

 have a guest. - Hey there, Juanita. - Okay, hit it. \"Hi.

 My name is Juanita Solis and I am in the third grade.\"

 - You're losing them. Get to the pitch. - \"Won't you support

 me? \"I am selling candy so I can stay in school \"and

 not end up on the street selling drugs.\" I'll take it from

 here. It's a fundraiser. Three bucks a bar. Whip out your wallets.

 Well, I'd hate to see Juanita on crack, so I'll buy one.

 - Me, too. Do you have caramel? - One lousy bar? Ladies,

 it's a contest. Juanita plans to win. Come on. Need I remind

 you of all the crap I've bought from your kids over the

 years? And I do mean crap. Not like this quality processed sugar

 I am peddling today. Juanita, MJ is playing in the other room.

 Why don't you go join him? Here's the thing. Before you got

 here, Bree and Lynette agreed to buy eight bars from MJ. It's

 okay. They can buy from Juanita, too. Well, it's a little more

 complicated than that. See, MJ is having a bit of a self-esteem

 crisis lately, and he feels like he's on a losing streak, so

 I really, really need him to win this one. - You understand,

 right? - Of course. - Thank you. - I understand, I just

 don't care. - Excuse me? - Juanita's having a crisis of her

 own. She's new to Oakridge and she's having trouble making new friends.

 As you know, the winner gets a big party and they can

 invite whoever they want, which could go a long way in helping

 her fit in. You understand, right? Sure. Of course. It's just, he's

 never won anything before. She has no friends. So, what are we

 doing? Well, it seems to me if we buy the same amount

 from both of you, it'll just be a wash, right? So, really,

 we don't need to buy any at all. Get out your wallet.

 I was so shocked to hear you had lung cancer. - I

 didn't even know you smoked. - I didn't. That's the thing. People

 think you have to be a smoker to get it, but you

 don't. A girl your age was having the same surgery I had,

 - never smoked a day in her life. - You could be

 that girl, Gabby. Let's get a drink. You know, since we're dying

 anyway. - Now, remember... - We're not a couple. I know. We're

 on a covert lesbian mission. I'm sorry. I just want people not

 to figure out we're together. - It'll blow their minds. - Oh,

 please. You stabbed yourself and blamed Mike, and this will blow their

 minds? - Hey, ladies. - Hi, Tom. Having fun? Best cancer party

 ever. Listen, I was talking to Karen's doctor. You made quite the

 impression on him. - Me? - Yeah, he begged me to introduce

 you. Do you mind? Why would I? We're only roommates. - And

 here's your change. Enjoy. - Hey! Willy Wonka! Selling candy at an

 \"I survived cancer\" party? Tacky. Chocolate is filled with antioxidants which, as

 we all know, fight disease. So, you could say that I just

 saved a life. Yeah, right. The competition is between the kids. They're

 supposed to be doing the selling, not the parents. Gabby! Speedo season

 is a month away and you have the nerve to sell this

 to my husband? and he was a doctor, he was a surgeon.

 - Oh. - Yeah. I always knew I'd go to med school.

 You know, that incredible feeling of helping people. Plus, they give you

 that little pad and you can write any prescription you want. Beautiful

 and laughs at my jokes. Two more cocktails and I may be

 proposing. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Can I talk to you for a

 minute? Will you excuse me, David? And she never smoked a day

 in her life. You could be that girl, Lee. Look, it's one

 thing to hide our relationship. It's another to flirt with a man

 right in my face. I wasn't flirting. He was flirting with me.

 - I saw your face. You were enjoying it. - Okay. Hey,

 listen up, everyone. I just want to thank you all for coming

 and to say to Karen, thank God you're all right, baby. Thanks,

 everybody. And I also want to thank the big guy upstairs. Now,

 if we could all take a moment to remember the people who

 weren't as lucky as I was. Make up your mind, Katherine! Are

 you gay or straight? I don't know! Just because I enjoy having

 sex with you doesn't make me a lesbian! Look at this. I

 wonder what Rex would say if he saw us here all together?

 Probably, \"Who's the guy in the wheelchair?\" So, Sam, Mom tells me

 you got some fancy degree? His MBA, which he earned while working

 two jobs and nursing his sick mother. - I just did what

 I had to do. - Don't be so modest. He also spent

 a summer in Micronesia helping to dig wells. It was challenging, but

 I really wanted to work with the poor. Sounds like my first

 job. You worked in the food court at the mall. The outlet

 mall. Trust me, I know what it's like to work with poor

 people. They're always late. Rex and I always hoped the children would

 take an interest in working with those less fortunate, but... We saw

 an opportunity to disappoint them once again and we grabbed it. So,

 my father was interested in charity work. - What else? - So

 many things. Travel, history, the arts. He especially loved music. - Really?

 Me, too. I play the guitar. - You do? Stay right there.

 - That was lovely. - I'm really rusty. Yeah, I could hear

 that. This is pretty cool. I'm actually playing my dad's guitar. It's

 just been sitting in that closet for years, gathering dust. - In

 fact, why don't you keep it? - What? What? Why not? You

 should have something to remember your father by. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait

 a minute. What if I want it? - What if Danielle wants

 it? - I don't want it. Don't you have a flight to

 catch? Andrew, you've never shown any interest in that thing. It's my

 dad's guitar. I'm plenty interested. - But you don't even play. -

 I do so. I took lessons, okay? Well, by all means. We'd

 love to hear. What fun, indeed. Now would you please give Sam

 the guitar? No! Well, if Andrew wants it that badly... He doesn't

 care about the guitar. He's just being unreasonable. You're giving out my

 dad's stuff to a total stranger and I'm unreasonable? Sam is a

 member of this family. Now, give him the guitar. Hey, I've got

 an idea. Why don't we split it? I must apologize. My presence

 here is clearly causing unhappiness. - I think I should go. -

 No need to apologize. You have behaved with the utmost dignity in

 the face of unthinkable rudeness. Thank you. Yeah, I know. He's the

 perfect son. Problem is, he's not yours. So, we talking yet? Jeez,

 Ang! What the hell? I'm getting bored with the silent treatment. So

 you might as well shoot me. - You had no right to

 tell her. - I know my mom, Nick. There was no other

 way she was letting go of Danny. So, are we over this?

 Because if not, I would really prefer a bullet in my head.

 It used to be just you, me and Patrick knew. - Now

 your mom. What if he finds out? - She is not gonna

 tell him. Ang, I love that boy. I was the one in

 the delivery room. I was the first one to hold him. -

 Even before you. - I know. I cannot let him find out

 from somebody else. - I have got to tell him. - No.

 You are his father. You gave up your life to protect him.

 You're the only father he needs to know about. Yeah, maybe you're

 right. Now please, get this the hell out of here, huh? Before

 someone gets hurt. I mean, I didn't think you'd do it, but

 I'm not stupid. - Hello? - It's Patrick Logan. Just got into

 town and I was hoping to drop by, you know, for the

 information? How about tomorrow night? See you then. And I've got a

 case of selective Alzheimer's, so don't forget the cash. Hey, Tina, it's

 Susan Bremer. I know, it's been a long time, not since graduation.

 So listen, do you remember the night that you got caught streaking

 and I had to bail you out of jail, and you said

 you owed me one? Well, I hope you like chocolate. Is that

 Mrs. Solis? Tina, I'm gonna have to call you back. Oh, my

 God. Is she selling candy? Among other things. I'm gonna lose this

 contest, aren't I? No. You're gonna win. 'Cause Mommy's done playing fair.

 Hey. Irina and I were talking, and we feel really bad about

 yesterday. Look, we don't want to come down too hard on you

 guys. We're just not comfortable having a couple of unmarried kids sleeping

 together in our house. - You understand. - Oh, yes. That is

 why Preston must tell you something now. Irina and I have decided

 to get our own apartment. - What? - That way, it'll be

 our place - and we can do whatever we want. - No.

 No, no, no. We're getting married in six months, anyway. Why not?

 Why not? Lynette, you want to take this one? I think it's

 a terrific idea. They're not kids anymore. They're old enough to make

 this decision. Thank you, Lynette. It's good to know we have your

 support. - See you later. - Okay. Have fun. What are you

 doing? We're supposed to pull them apart, not push them together. Do

 you remember that apartment we moved into when we were saving for

 this house? That dump? Yeah, it was the size of a closet.

 You remember how we treated each other? I remember a lot of

 yelling and throwing stuff. God, there were a few times I was

 afraid that we were gonna... Break up? Lynette, you are devious and

 evil, and I have never been more in love with you. -

 Susan Delfino, you are so busted! - Gabby? What are you doing

 here? Alice Gibson told me what you were up to, but I

 couldn't believe you would sink so low. I don't know what you're

 talking about. Okay, folks, we're on a break. Somebody's gotta take their

 meds. No, not yet, not yet. Will you stop at nothing to

 win this competition? - That's funny, coming from you. - Me? I

 have nothing to be ashamed of. Well, let me jog your memory.

 Construction site, cold wind, no bra. - You saw that? - Yeah.

 Did I not tell you how important this was to MJ? Yes,

 and I told you about Juanita. But apparently your son's problems are

 more important - than anybody else's! - That is not what I'm

 saying. Whatever. We are done here. And just so you know, I

 am taking the gloves off. Well, why not? You've taken off everything

 else. Candy for sale! Help a young boy walk again. Hi, Katherine.

 I haven't seen you since the party. How you doing? - Still

 humiliated. Thanks for asking. - Come on. It wasn't that bad. My

 sex life was laid bare for the entire neighborhood. What could be

 worse? Let's see. You could've thrown a party to celebrate getting over

 cancer and had a couple of lesbians steal your thunder. Sorry about

 that. But it's not funny, knowing everyone is out there judging me.

 Let me ask you something. Do you really like this girl? I

 don't know. I think I might. Then why do you give a

 damn what anyone else thinks? People just stopped seeing me as the

 crazy lady on the street. I'm not ready for them to start

 seeing me as the middle-aged lesbian, okay? Well, if you care that

 much about what people think, you've got two choices. Dump the girl,

 or move someplace where people don't gossip, if such a place exists.

 Not much of a choice. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

 Oh. I get it. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Break it

 up. This is how rumors get started. What smells so good? -

 That's borscht. - Borscht! Irina's making dinner. You kids have been so

 busy looking for your apartment, we've hardly seen you the last couple

 of days. Yeah, you find something you like? Put down a deposit

 on a place yesterday. Well! Don't be freaked out about the size.

 You two will have so much fun that you won't even notice

 how small it is. Is not small. Three bedrooms and a balcony.

 How are you going to afford a three-bedroom apartment - while you're

 going to college? - You tell them. I serve borscht. - Tell

 us what? - Well, you're right. We can't afford anything nice on

 our budget, so I'm gonna put off college and get a job.

 Say something. Are you sure you've thought this thing through? Because, you

 know, you need to have a college education to get a good

 job. - I already got a good job. - You did? Where?

 The meat-packing plant. I'm a gutter. - A gutter? - Well, I'm

 the guy who scoops out all... Yeah. Yeah, I know what it

 is! Well, did you know I get paid 14 bucks an hour

 plus benefits? Seriously? What is it, a union job? Those jobs are

 hard to get. You'll probably get a discount on steaks, too. Your

 son just announced that he's giving up college so he can be

 the guy in charge of guts, and all you can say is,

 \"Oh, boy, free meat\"? This is good job. The money is a

 lot. What is problem? Maybe in Russia it's every mother's dream for

 her son to see what the inside of a cow looks like,

 - but not in my home! - Lynette, calm down. You could

 be a doctor. You could be a lawyer. Why are you so

 intent on throwing your life away? - Mom. - He is going

 to support his wife. That is what men do for woman they

 love. He's not in love! He's blinded by a piece of self-serving

 Euro-trash who would sell her own mother for a pair of designer

 jeans! - Hey. Thanks. - What's with the bike? Eddie thinks he

 can get me a couple shifts down at the coffee shop, and

 since you guys are too cheap to buy me a car... First

 job. Hey, look at you. - God, what happened to my little

 boy? - I grew up. - That's kind of the way it

 works. - No, I know, I know. It's just... God, you never

 think it's gonna go as fast as it does. You're so busy

 just getting through the day, you don't realize they're starting to add

 up. - What's wrong? - What do you mean? Well, you got

 that look that says, \"I got something to tell you, and it

 ain't gonna be pretty.\" - Yeah, well, you know me, right? -

 Of course I do. You're my dad. So, what's up? Yeah, you're

 right. I am your dad. Nothing. Forget about it. Work on your

 bike. Hey. Congrats on the job. - Who is it? - Patrick

 Logan. Hope you like roses. I'm sorry I couldn't get an address

 or anything. - You got me everything I needed. - Good. So,

 then I guess... Of course. I know you've been looking for Angie

 for a long time, but there's not gonna be any trouble, right?

 Trouble? Well, you're not gonna, like, hurt her or anything? She took

 something of mine. I want it back. Okay. It's just... I like

 Rose, and I don't ever want to hear that something bad's happened

 to her kid. You should get that money to the bank. This

 place doesn't seem very safe to me. What are you talking about?

 Look at all those locks. Yeah, but what if someone were to

 come up this fire escape? That window's always locked. You think that's

 gonna stop them? What are you doing? Then they reach through, unlock

 the window, and now you're in trouble. May I speak to you?

 How will this conversation end? With beef Stroganoff on my head? I

 am sorry. Please do forgive. I want us to be friends. -

 Really? - Think how hard it is for Preston. Caught in the

 middle between our fighting, when he wants us to love each other

 only. Yes? I don't want to put Preston in the middle, but

 I am his mother, and I will fight for his best interests

 till the day I die. You mean you will fight me. Yeah.

 You understand English just fine. Now you should understand. I told Preston

 I want to move up wedding to next week, - and he

 said yes. - Next week? The wedding is not for another six

 months. We cannot wait that long. It is too hard for Preston

 to choose between a mother and a girlfriend. So, once I am

 his wife, choice will be much easier. No. No, you can't do

 this. You met each other six weeks ago. Preston barely knows you.

 But you do, yes? You think you know all about me, and

 in much less time than that. There. From one Mrs. Scavo to

 another. I found some of your father's old yearbooks up in the

 attic. I thought you might enjoy looking at them. - He played

 football? - Yes, and he was student body president. So what else

 can you tell me about him? Even my mom didn't really know

 him that well. He was incredibly smart, funny, and so graceful. What's

 wrong? I just never get to talk about Rex anymore. Since I

 remarried, it just doesn't seem appropriate. I hadn't realized how much I

 miss him. Well, you can talk to me about him anytime you

 want. You have his smile. What are you doing out here? Mostly

 kicking myself. - I can't believe how I acted at dinner. -

 Well, it was a fraught situation. There was bound to be some

 sort of scene. Look, I know he's my brother, I know I

 should try to like him, but there's something about him I just

 don't trust. - I know what you mean. - You do? He's

 trying awfully hard to get close to Bree. - I, for one,

 would like to know why. - You think he has an agenda?

 We all have agendas, Andrew. Mine is to protect your mother. -

 What do we really know about Sam? - Just the stuff he

 tells us. Mmm. Which seems a bit too good to be true,

 doesn't it? Maybe my agenda should be to find out everything I

 can. Why shouldn't you? He's your brother. Hey, Jean, quick question. How

 is MJ doing? You know, I'd like to see a little more

 effort in math. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not in class. I mean

 the candy drive. Today's the last day. Susan, you should be so

 proud. He is a selling machine. - Way out ahead of the

 whole school. - Yes! - Except for Juanita Solis. - No! But

 don't worry, she is just two bars ahead. You'd better get him

 out there. Gabby Solis told me she's taking Juanita to sell outside

 a weight-loss clinic. Ka-ching! Mrs. Delfino, can I go now? My mom

 wants to pick me up a couple of minutes early. Does she?

 Sure, sweetheart. Why don't you just help Vanessa put her brushes away

 first? What is that? Did someone bring a cell phone into my

 classroom? Juanita Solis, is this your cell phone? No. Come on, now.

 It was in your bag. Whose else could it be? Yours. My

 mom gave it to you for your birthday. Oh. - So are

 you saying that you stole it? - No! Now you're yelling at

 me! Someone just bought herself three hours of detention. Hello? Hi, Principal

 Hobson. Everything okay? Detention? No, no, no! We only have a few

 hours left to sell candy. Who gave her detention? She did, huh?

 Thanks for letting me know. Hi, MJ. Must be getting thirsty, walking

 around in this heat. Doesn't a nice, big, ice-cold cup of soda

 sound good? - Hello? - I have something that belongs to you.

 Check your cell phone. MJ. He's supposed to be out selling. He

 was. Then you gave my daughter detention. Bad move. - All right.

 What do you want? - Let her go and I let him

 go. - I don't trust you. - I don't blame you. Bring

 him here. We'll make the exchange. Fine. But I'm warning you. If

 there is one chocolate bar missing from that girl's box, you'll answer

 to me. Your mom will be here soon. Don't worry, you'll be

 out selling your candy in no time. I hope so. I gotta

 win. You know, Juanita, there are other kids that want to win,

 too. I know. I just want my mom to be proud of

 me. Your mom is proud of you. Sometimes I think she's embarrassed

 because I don't have any friends. Every day I come home and

 she asks, \"Did you make any friends today?\" She just wants to

 make sure that you're happy, sweetie. That's all. I guess. I just

 wish I could make friends as easy as she does. I try

 and I try, but I just can't. Hello. We would've gotten here

 sooner, but your son can't hold his soda. Juanita, come on. We've

 got candy to sell. Mom, we've gotta go, too, otherwise Juanita's gonna

 beat me. Sweetie, I know you want to win, but let's talk

 about what winning really means. I've rehearsed this speech a hundred times.

 Well, I think I know how it ends. I can't live my

 life with everyone in the neighborhood watching me and judging me. I

 care too much about what people think. - So you want me

 to leave. - Yeah. Yeah. But if you wouldn't mind, I'd like

 to go with you. Seriously? I want to figure out what we

 have here. And once I know, maybe I won't care what anyone

 thinks. - Well, you know what I think? - What? I've always

 wanted to see Paris. And the winner of this year's candy drive

 is... Juanita Solis. We did it! You did it. Okay, now, go

 invite your brand new friends to your party. - Mrs. Henderson. Tell

 me, was it close? - Really close. Until the last day, when

 Juanita sold 40 bars and MJ didn't sell any. Really? That's weird.

 Hey, MJ. - I'm sorry you didn't win. - That's okay. I'm

 curious about something. How come you didn't sell any candy yesterday? My

 mom says it's a secret. She says it's only a good deed

 if we don't tell. Well, you should listen to your mother, because

 she's a winner, just like you. There are a lot of ways

 to win in this world. Some battles are won with a hasty

 retreat. Some victories are claimed by those willing to cheat. Some opponents

 are defeated with nothing more than a smile. Of course, for some,
