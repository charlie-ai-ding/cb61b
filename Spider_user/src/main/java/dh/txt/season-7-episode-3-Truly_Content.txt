 on... Susan showed a certain flair for her new job. There you

 go. You're getting good at this. Renee rented a house. - That

 is so... - Wonderful? Close. - There's something I have to tell

 you. - Gaby learned the truth about her daughter being switched at

 birth. Paul Young continued to surprise everyone. I see you've all met

 my wife. And Tom came home with a mysterious affliction. I'm not

 feeling well. Again? I'm just gonna lie on the couch and watch

 some TV. Tom Scavo was depressed, and his wife had done everything

 she could to cheer him up. She had made his favorite meals.

 She had told her funniest jokes. She'd even worn her sexiest lingerie.

 But nothing worked. Finally, Lynette insisted her husband go to the doctor.

 Unfortunately, what he came home with was a prescription for trouble. Antianxiety

 medication? This is what he gave you? Dr. Weiler says it will

 help. He spent 20 minutes with you. Let me guess. Did he

 write this with a drug company's pen? I need this medicine. Then

 take it, but I gotta tell ya, those drugs scare the crap

 out of me. I gotta do something. I am so tired of

 feeling this way. But you've gone through rough patches before. You could

 come out of it. Wait around to get better? That's your answer?

 You don't know what it's like inside my head! You're right. I'm

 sorry. Remember when Susan kept having all those headaches? Who was that

 guy that she went to? Doctor... Ross. - How is he gonna

 be any different? - He's holistic. He tries to stay away from

 heavy meds. Susan loved him. And if he says I should be

 on this? Then you have a second opinion. Whatever he says, I'll

 go with it. I saw Dr. Ross. I'm so glad. Did you

 like him? Loved him. And you were right. He doesn't believe in

 pharmaceuticals. He only prescribes stuff that's totally herbal and natural. That is

 fantastic. So what did he suggest? Medical marijuana. Tom Scavo had been

 battling depression, but he was now facing a much bigger battle with

 his wife. Sous-titres Wisteria Team www.wisteria-team.fr www.sous-titres.eu Happiness... It's something we all

 want, and so we search for it. Little girls find it in

 the taste of chocolate. Well-dressed men discover it at their local mall.

 Teenage boys experience it when talking to a pretty girl. And then

 there are housewives, who simply can't be happy until they've learned everything

 they can about the newest neighbor on the block. So sorry to

 interrupt. This will just take a second. We wanted to officially welcome

 you to the neighborhood. This is my friend Lynette and Susan, and

 I was telling them about you, and we... - Just had to

 meet you. - Immediately. That's so sweet. You're my landlady, right? Yes,

 but I really want you to think of me as a friend.

 Are those pictures hung on the wall with nails or... We wanted

 to invite you to our weekly poker game. Shoot. I don't know

 how to play poker. Don't worry. We'll teach you. Does that ficus

 tree have a saucer underneath? Those are hardwood floors. While you're learning

 about Texas Hold'em, we'll learn about you. That sounds fun. We should

 be going. We'll see you later. What did those women want? They

 invited me to play cards with them. But they were just being

 friendly. On this street, never confuse being nosy with being friendly. They

 were digging for dirt. Do you not want me to go? You

 will go. Give them all sorts of meaningless information. And hopefully, they'll

 start to think of you as a friend. But if you don't

 like them, why do you want me to be friends with them?

 In time, it will be useful. Where's the pen? Don't you wanna

 read it first? Why? Did a nurse get drunk and swap it

 with a different document? By signing this, Mr. Solis, you are agreeing

 not to bring any legal action against this hospital. Do you understand?

 In return, you'll stop searching for the other family. Do you understand?

 Done. Babe, we talked about this. We don't know how this other

 family will react, and we need to protect Juanita. I am sorry,

 Gabrielle. I can only imagine how you must feel. You can't begin

 to imagine how I feel. The only person who could is the

 woman who has my daughter. If signing can spare her this pain...

 Then I will do it. I love it! Somehow I get the

 feeling you don't love it. I don't love it. It's just so...

 Yellow. Trust me. This will be great. Besides, when you're in the

 room, nobody's looking at the walls anyway. You certainly know how to

 sell yellow. Excuse me. I hear you're gettin' divorced. And good morning

 to you. I'm getting divorced, too. So we both need guys. I'm

 thinking we should hang. I don't know how much Lynette has told

 you about me, but I'm really not one for... hanging. Look, one

 woman at a bar is just sad. But two, and it's girls'

 night out. So what do you say? You up for a little

 stud hunting? That's a lovely offer, but I think I'm gonna pass.

 Come on. We gotta get back in the game, cut loose, let

 our hair down. That hair does come down, doesn't it? Really, Renee,

 that is just not how I like to meet men. How else

 you gonna meet 'em, sittin' around your house? You'd be surprised. -

 You've met someone already? - Maybe. A beautiful, classy woman who can

 get a man without leaving the house. I don't see us being

 friends. I don't know how everything gets so dirty in here. Is

 that a piece of lint? It got my apron! I'd better sign

 off before I'm completely naked. See you tomorrow, boys. I'm busy! Honey,

 it's Maxine! A star is born! Did you watch? Not only did

 I watch, I kvelled. I have to admit, I am sort of

 getting into it. That thing with the vacuum just came to me.

 That's how it happens with the great ones. Here's a bonus for

 you. What's this for? A little something I do for the girl

 who gets the most hits in a month. You just unseated Stacy

 Strauss, and with the caboose on her, that's not easy. You're so

 good to me. Mike and I are finally starting to save some

 money. Don't save it all. Buy yourself something nice. You deserve it.

 By the way, have you decided what you're gonna do for tomorrow's

 show? I'm gonna damp mop in bikini briefs. Are you trying to

 make me cry? Bye, doll. This is a great sandwich. What's in

 it? It's nothing. Just a little Parma ham cured by Italian monks

 and some cave-aged gruy?re, and of course I make my own fig

 mustard. Cooking is a passion of mine. Of course, it's not much

 fun cooking for one. If you're free this weekend... Babe, you gotta

 try this sandwich. It rocks. This is my boss, Mrs. Van De

 Kamp. This is Stephanie, my girlfriend. You have a girlfriend? Of course

 you have... A girlfriend who's young and pretty. Nice to meet you.

 I'm sorry, Bree. What were you about to ask me? It's, wasn't

 important. You enjoy your sandwich. Inside, over there. Let the stud hunt

 begin. Come on. We're gonna get started. You okay? Let's play cards.

 When I was 8, daddy left mama, we were pretty much alone.

 Most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic. Of course, there

 were always mama's boyfriends, but as soon as I'd learn their names,

 mama would kick them out, and there'd be a new toothbrush in

 the bathroom. Let me know if I'm sharing too much. Not at

 all. Keep pouring the chardonnay. She's cracking like an egg. Okay, quarter

 ante. Beth, how did you and Paul meet anyway? I don't wanna

 bore you. We won't be bored. More chardonnay? I saw his picture

 in the paper during his trial, there was something about those eyes

 that spoke to me. What about the headline? \"Arrested for murder\". That

 didn't speak to you? I'll admit that gave me pause. But then

 we started corresponding, and I discovered what a wonderful man Paul really

 is. Bree, let's forget about hittin' the clubs tomorrow night. Clearly, all

 the best guys are on death row. But, you can't help who

 you fall in love with, right? And Paul's a real lady-killer. We

 always fogged up the plexiglas with that one. It's good that you

 can laugh about it. The thing is, in my heart, I always

 knew he was innocent, and I was right. Well, he is. So

 let's play cards. What are you doing? Preparing to take my medicine.

 I've heard that an increase in appetite's a possible side effect, I'm

 taking the necessary precautions. Necessary precautions being your own weight in cheese

 doodles? I never smoked pot before, so I wanna be prepared. -

 Headphones? - Pink Floyd. Apparently, it complements the medicinal properties of... Blueberry

 bliss. Listen to you. You are loving this. Tom the college nerd

 gets to finally smoke pot and be cool. I was plenty cool

 in college. The only reason I didn't smoke back then was because

 I signed abstinence pledge with my Dungeons & Dragons club. What do

 you say? Care to join me out back behind the garage for

 a little doobage? \"Doobage\"? That's what you're calling your medicine now? Come

 on. You need to take this seriously. I am. Really? 'Cause I'm

 pretty sure I've never asked you to join me behind the garage

 to split a midol. You said you would go with this. I

 know, but how is it gonna look to the kids? I don't

 want them seeing their dad stoned. You don't have to worry about

 them seeing me stoned. They'll never know. What do you wanna do

 Saturday night? I was thinking that we could go to Chez Naomi.

 Isn't our price range more Chez chicken hut? Mike, it's our anniversary.

 Besides, we've been working really hard. We deserve it. Bring your big

 purse 'cause we're taking the dinner rolls home. Chez Naomi? Expensive place.

 Yeah, I guess it is. Must be nice. Have we met? I'm

 in 1b. I know who you are. I'm 1f. Stacy Strauss. You're

 one of Maxine's... It's nice to meet you. Guess we... kind of

 do the same thing. Sometimes we do exactly the same thing. -

 What? - I keep an eye on the competition. You lifted one

 of my moves. No, I didn't. You expect me to believe you

 just woke up one day, decided to put a feather duster in

 your mouth? You do that? It's my signature bit, and you stole

 it. I swear... I don't watch the other girls perform. So I

 guess it's just a coincidence. Here's another coincidence... You're getting the big

 bonus check, I'm not. That's not... really what you'd call a coincidence.

 - That's more... - All right. Just keep the duster out of

 your mouth. And watch your back. Everything okay? I am wasted. Really?

 I am Lucy in the sky high. This must be pretty intense

 for you. Don't forget. Tomorrow we have to trombone 3-d banana patch.

 Remember? Man, this is really strong stuff. Snow shovel. Exactly. I was

 just upstairs watching Paige sleep, with her little fingers and her little

 toes. I must've watched her for, like, an hour. She's just so

 perfect. And I am so... lucky. I couldn't feel happier than I

 do right now. I mean just so happy it's working. What do

 you think? Does this say \"Happy anniversary, Mike. I'll love you forever\"?

 I think it says \"credit card declined\". Aren't you and Mike on

 a budget? But things are starting to turn around lately. - I've

 been selling a lot of my jewelry. - Get out! Out there

 and keep selling. Hello, silk! How I've missed your soft touch. I'm

 going to the dressing room. You two have fun. Mommy? You're not

 my mommy. Are you lost? What's your name? Kiki! You scared me!

 I couldn't find you. I have a little girl, too. Sometimes they

 get distracted and wander off. Let's go. Wait! How old is she?

 Eight. My daughter's 8. When's your birthday? We've really gotta go. What

 hospital was she born in? Was it Fairview memorial? Standing there in

 the mall, it just hit me. I can't spend the rest of

 my life wondering if every little girl I see is my daughter.

 Not knowing where she is, it's like my heart living outside of

 my body. I have to find her. There's a private Detective I

 work with. But Sanchez is a pretty common name. It's not surprising

 the hospital couldn't find 'em. I know something the hospital doesn't. When

 I was in labor, the other woman's mother came into my room

 by mistake, and we got to talking. She lived in el Paso,

 and she was so excited to have her granddaughter baptized at Santa

 Maria's church. That's gonna help. So you think you can find her?

 We'll do our best. Carlos is on board with this, right? Absolutely.

 Okay, then give me ten porterhouse. I just came by to pick

 up my envelope for the week. Okay. Inside. And don't listen to

 this conversation. It's about your Christmas gift. I'm buying all my girls

 steaks. You got a preference? Whatever meat you put in my stocking

 will be fine. That sounds dirty. Use that. I'm back. What else

 have you got for me? Rib eye? I like it. Is that

 a piece of lint? That's my bit. Maxine! What? I'm on with

 the meat guy. But Stacy Strauss is stealing my vacuum bit! If

 she's gonna do that, at least teach her how to use the

 nozzle. Hey there. I'm ready to party. Are you? 'Cause you look

 like you're ready to tour the Reagan library. This is a cocktail

 cardigan. Look closely. The buttons are shiny. Where's your closet? I have

 never seen so many sweater sets. Are you sure this is a

 closet and not a portal to the 1950s? There is nothing wrong

 with my clothing. Bree, you're going to a hot young club full

 of hot young people. You need to dress the part. Well, I

 happen to find it distasteful when mutton is dressed as lamb. Look,

 when women go out clubbing, there's two ways they can pair up...

 Pretty girl/pretty girl or pretty girl/grenade. Which do you wanna be? Fine.

 Now we're getting somewhere. Love the plunging neckline. That's the back. This

 place is dead. Really? I forgot we were in the sticks. Everyone

 hooked up early so they could be home in time for \"nightline\".

 Actually, tonight's \"nightline\" sounds very interesting. - It's about the genocide in...

 - Hold on. Fresh talent at the end of the bar. That's

 my contractor. Call me a fixer-upper. Don't bother. He's got a girlfriend.

 If I don't see her, she doesn't exist. What's so funny? My

 girlfriend's about to make a fool of herself. She's hitting on that

 guy, and I happen to know he has a very beautiful, very

 young girlfriend. You talking about Keith? You know him? And Stephanie dumped

 him this afternoon, which is why he's here, drowning his sorrows. I

 didn't recognize you. Keith, what a lovely surprise. I didn't know you

 were here. But I'm bagging. I gotta work tomorrow. Boss is pretty

 strict. Good. I mean, yes, I'm very strict. See you in the

 morning. There ya go. That's how you bait the hook. I won't

 need a ride. I'm going home with Keith. I don't think so.

 He just left. He's pulling the car around. Now you think I

 should play the \"I hate going into a dark house alone\" card,

 or the more blatant \"I'm not wearing underwear\"? 'Cause I'm not. Okay,

 before you do anything hasty, he just broke up with his girlfriend.

 He's very fragile. I'll be careful when I unwrap him. Renee, wait.

 Please don't go home with Keith. Why? He's the one you like,

 isn't he? I am thinking about you. You don't want to come

 off like a slut. Gee, then chip won't ask me to the

 prom. Renee, wait! What about me? It's getting late. Stay in the

 dim light and don't play hard to get. Keith, hi. It's Bree.

 I don't know if you're in bed yet, but I'm having a

 bit of an emergency. Thank you. That's lovely. Why would somebody do

 something like this? Far be it from me to understand the minds

 of hooligans. I'm so sorry to call you over here at this

 hour. It's okay. I wasn't doing anything special. Good. I would love

 to show my appreciation. Perhaps one night this week, I could make

 you dinner. You mean... Like a date? We don't have to put

 a label on it. Just two adults eating... Food together. Calling it

 a date is quicker. Well, I see no reason to argue. Shall

 we say... 08 P.M. on Thursday? McCluskey, right? I was hoping I

 might see you at the girl's poker game. Not anymore. You get

 caught with a couple of aces in your bra, and you're banned

 for life. Couldn't help but notice they don't seem to like my

 husband very much. Do you know why that is? Nope. Nobody tells

 me anything. Mrs. McCluskey, I really need to know. Fine. They think

 he's a murderer. But he was exonerated. Felicia Tillman framed him. Yeah,

 for that crime. What do you mean? Before Felicia showed up around

 here, her sister Martha was murdered. And, all due respect, you're shacking

 up with suspect number one. Does everybody think that? Felicia may be

 a few fingers short of a high five, but if she's crazy,

 we all are. Well, that's enough dusting for today, boys. I guess

 all that's left is a little vacuuming. Get the vacuum. I think

 I got some schmutz on my apron. Get that off. I love

 this show. Hello, boys. For those of you who might be switching

 over from other channels, welcome. I have a very dirty apartment. Open

 up! Little busy! I know you did it. Did what? I don't

 know what you're talking about. So you're not just a thief. You're

 a liar. Be careful how you talk to me, you gigantic freak.

 I am about to slap that cheap blush right off your face.

 Is that supposed to scare me, man hands? I'm gonna show you

 a whole new place to stick that feather duster. Well, I'm sure

 wherever it is, you copied the idea from watching me. - I

 need those bonus checks! - So do I! I am trying to

 get out of this business! And you think I wanna spend the

 rest of my life dusting in my underwear? You're off camera! Roll

 left. I'm so glad you're here. What are you doing? She attacked

 me. 'Cause she broke into my apartment and... Hang on. This isn't

 a bit? No! I was in the middle of doing my show,

 and she burst in here and started hitting me. Did you do

 that? Yes, but... You know the rules, Strauss! You never, ever interrupt

 a show! Now go to your room. But... I said go. You

 all right? - Yeah. - All right. Good. I gotta call tech

 support. You girls had so many hits, it fried my router. A

 roving gang of hooligans destroyed your sprinklers? - Shameful, isn't it? -

 You know what I think? I think this is the hair work

 of a lonely, desperate woman. You left out \"resourceful.\" Nobody steals a

 man out of my bed. But you know what? I've been looking

 for a new hobby, and taking you down is as good as

 any. I think you'd be wise to stick to your original hobby

 of forgoing undergarments. Be seeing you, Bree. Looking forward to it. Maxine

 says I can't go back online until I apologize to you, so...

 I apologize. And I thought your acting was bad on the web

 site. Fine. I am sorry, okay? I shouldn't have stolen your bit.

 What was going through your mind? I freaked out when I didn't

 get that bonus check. See, my family's in Virginia, and I'm saving

 up to move back home. I know what that's like. And even

 with that extra money, I feel like I'm living week to week.

 Really? 'Cause when I broke in your apartment, I noticed that you

 had some awfully nice stuff. Flat screen TV, closet full of new

 clothes. I know. Probably shouldn't have bought all that. But you know

 how it is. Every once in a while, you want a little

 splurge. Yeah, I get that. But... definitely by the end of the

 year, I'm going to be outta here. Me, too. How long have

 you been doing this? I guess I'm going on six years. Would

 you mind if we just stayed home and ordered Chinese for our

 anniversary? Wait. No suit? No tie? No pretentious euro waiter listing specials

 that I can't understand? Dang it, Susan! Why? Seriously, why'd you change

 your mind? I thought you wanted a little treat. I think we

 should save that money and stay focused on what we're trying to

 do. And we can have a fancy dinner and celebrate when we

 move back home. I had a lovely time at the poker game

 the other day. Really? What's the neighborhood saying about me? Well... For

 starters, a lot of people seem to think you killed... What's her

 name? Martha something. Huber. I guess Felicia Tillman spread her poison pretty

 wide. I guess she did. I'm not a murderer, you know. I

 know. But I fell in love with you before I knew that,

 so even if you were... I'm always gonna be on your side.

 Remember that. Everything okay? You look a little... It's been an intense

 couple weeks. I'm sorry, buddy. What if I told you I could

 ease some of that stress? You're not gonna offer me a back

 rub? A mind rub. You got this from a doctor? Really cool

 doctor. Now I gotta warn you, this stuff is chronic. I got

 totally baked off of it this morning. I did not have you

 pegged as a stoner. Dude... There's a lot that you don't know

 about me. I hate to break this to you, but... This isn't

 pot. Tell me that in five minutes when we are soaring past

 the rings of Saturn. Trust me, cheech. This is oregano. No way.

 I bought it at a legit dispensary. Somebody must have switched it

 on you, the only thing getting baked with it - is lasagna.

 - Who would do that? - You! - Jeez. You scared me.

 I know what you did. Whatever do you mean? Yeah. That was

 me. This isn't funny, Lynette! You thought you were getting stoned on

 a pizza topping. It's a little funny. My sense of betrayal is

 huge at this moment. Why don't you snort some baking powder? You'll

 feel better. I'm glad you're enjoying this. Glad you enjoy making a

 fool of me. That was not my intention. I only threw out

 the pot because I didn't think you needed it, and you know,

 I was right. You got happy all on your own. Don't try

 to justify what you did by making it seem like some sort

 of \"master plan.\" It wasn't a master plan. I lucked out because

 for some reason, while you were... high on oregano, you made a

 decision to live in the moment. You stood over our daughter's crib

 and you let go of the stress and the fear, and you

 focused on the good in your life. But I am sorry I

 tricked you. You're evil. I should have expected it. Where are you

 going? To look at our beautiful daughter. Then I gotta turn that

 bong I made back into a lamp. - Anything? - We found

 them. My God. What'd they say? I haven't called them yet. Are

 you sure you still wanna do this? What? Yes, of course. You

 need to realize, once we call these people, and they know what's

 happened, it'll change your family forever. Call them. Juanita, come here. I

 didn't do it. I know. I was putting on some makeup. I

 thought you might like some. Can you put the big fake eyelashes

 on me? Of course, and... big rosy cheeks. Look how grown-up you

 are. Before you know it, you're gonna be going to college, have

 boyfriends, get married. I'm not getting married. I don't wanna leave you

 and daddy... ever. Do you know how much I love you? To

 the moon and back. That's right. No matter what happens, I will

 always love you to the moon and back. I need to sit

 down with you and Gaby. Why? I just called the family. It

 got pretty intense. What are you talking about? And now in a

 selection from Dior's fall line, the world's newest supermodel... Juanita! Hold the

 world in contempt. That's it. Now you look like a model. Hi,

 daddy. What's wrong? I just spoke to Bob. Sweetie, why don't you

 go to your room? And I'll be there in a sec. How

 could you have done this? We talked about this! We agreed. No,

 you agreed. You rushed me into signing that paper without giving me

 a chance - to think about what I was doing. - You

 understand what could happen? She is our flesh and blood, and she's

 out there! I need to know how she's doing. I need to

 know she's okay! And what if they want Juanita back? They can

 take her from us. They can do that now! They're not gonna

 give up their daughter. We don't know that! We don't know anything

 about them! You have no idea what you've started here! Mommy! Coming,

 sweetie! If this ends badly, I will never forgive you. I mean

 it, Gabrielle. We're done. Happiness... It's something everyone searches for. Some are

 sure they'll find it once they've moved back home. Some think they'll

 find it by making a new friend. Some hope to find it

 once they've defeated the competition. Then there are those who stop searching

 for happiness because they look up one day to discover... It was
