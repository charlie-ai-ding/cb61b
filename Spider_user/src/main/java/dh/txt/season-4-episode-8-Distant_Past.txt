 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives Mike was the victim... Of a hit and run.

 Lynette couldn't forgive her ther's past. You had tom to come home

 to. I had your stepfather. Hey, glen may have bored you, but

 the years we had a father in that house were the happiest

 of my life. You drove him away. Mom, where's grandma going? Bree

 got her second chance to be a good mother. Mike's dependency grew...

 Addicts are experts at deception. Victor! Get up. I wanna see the

 look on your face when the knife goes in. And victor was

 lost at sea. We think of the past as water under the

 bridge, a current that carries away the mistakes of our youth-- the

 loves we lost... The addictions we gave into... The opportunities we threw

 away... But sooner or later, reminders drift back into our lives... Of

 the mistakes we made... And the sins we committed. Carlos, why are

 you calling me? I told you we can't be seen together. I

 can't take it anymore. We gotta go to the cops. Oh, okay.

 And say what? \"yes, officer, \"my lover and i knocked my husband

 overboard twice and left him for dead. Okay.Bye-bye. \" i don't think

 so. But he's the mayor. You know, people are gonna notice he's

 missing, and then they're gonna ask questions. Let them ask. No one

 knows we were on that boat. Let's just play dumb and ride

 this thing out. Gaby, don't you feel guilty? A man is dead.

 Yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives. It was self-defense.

 Exactly. So then why don't we go and tell the police? He

 took the lord's name in vain. Look, we have a good plan.

 Let's just stick to it. Okay, okay. I won't say anything. Good.

 Now until this blows over, don't call me again. What are you

 doing now? I'm praying for a miracle. Carlos, if victor had lived,

 he would've killed us. I'm thinking we already had our miracle. Yes,

 the mistakes of our past have a way of drifting back into

 our lives... And when they do... We have to pay for them.

 /One day in the early fall, /Mike Delfino hurt his shoulder God.

 To ease his pain, he took a little white pill recommended by

 his doctor. The pain persisted, so he took another... And another. Unfortunately,

 when mike's pain began to subside, his need for the little white

 pills... Did not. But mike never shared this with those who cared

 about him, only with those who could not have cared less. Hey,

 it's mike. I'm out. I need to meet you tomorrow. Great. Got

 that money you owe me? No, but you know i'm good for

 it. You price chistry textbooks lately? They're, like, 300 bucks. I need

 my money, mike. And you'll get it, all right? Can't you just

 front me something for now? Well, advice is free. Pills aren't. My

 advice--get some cash. So, hey, you know, i better get going. Yeah,

 um, i should, too. Mom. Can we talk? This will just take

 a second. Did you kiss thaboy? No, i was kind of interrupted.

 Oh, well, you're gonna tnk me. Do you know that he has

 his tongue pierced? Yeah. He showed me. How do you know? I

 checked out his web page. You did not. I did, too, and

 do you know what else he has pierced? And if you do,

 you're grounded. Okay, yes, mom, derek has bought into the who piercing

 craze, but aren't you the one who told me to not judge

 a book by its cover? If the cover has holes in it,

 the book is no good. Okay, this conversation is over. I am

 going to kiss derek good night. Oh, fine. Break my heart. Why

 are you freaking out? We're just dating. It's not like he's trying

 to put a ring on my finger. Trust me. Your finger is

 not where he'd put it. Aw, he's so beautiful when he sleeps.

 I'll put him in the crib. No, he'll be sleeping with us.

 Why? Is he running a fever? He's fine, but i've been doing

 so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better

 next to their parents. It's called the \"family bed\". Ono, i've heard

 of that. Isn't it designed to facilitate breast-feeding? Partly. What's your point?

 You're not lactating. If our son wants to be near the milk,

 he'll have to sleep in the refrigerator. This isn't just for me

 and benjamin. This will help you bond with him, too. Oh, perhaps,

 but it's sure not gonna help me bond with you. Darling, sex

 is the last thing women want right after they've given birth. But

 you didn't give birth. You watched and served refreshments. Well, that doesn't

 make caring for an infant any less tiring. Can't we just give

 it a chance? I suppose. What if i roll over and crush

 him? Don't. Yes, hi. I'm looking for my mom. She hangs out

 at your bar sometimes. Stella wingfield? Uh, older lady, big oker, talks

 like a teamster. Well, that's your fault for letting her run a

 tab. Look, if you see her, could you tell her to call

 lynette? Thank you. I know that you are worried, but i am

 sure your mother is fine. She's broke and old and rude. That

 is not a winning combination on the street. Stella is very resourceful.

 Didn't you tell me that she once made her own booze by

 putting a bag of oranges under the radiator? Lucy, lydia and i

 fought over who had to take her. She was right outside. God

 only knows what she heard us say. Yeah, well, after the crap

 she puyou guys through, you have every right to resent her. It

 is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're

 safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there,

 maybe lying facedown in an alley... This is exactly what she wants

 you to do. She wants you to feel guilty. Don't buy into

 it. Okay. Okay. I guess you're right. Lynette. The morgue is listed

 under government offices, right? Mrs.Lang? The police are here. Ma'am. I'm detective

 berry. This is detective lyons. Can we ask you a few questions?

 Of course. When was the last time you saw mr.Lang? I guess

 two days ago. Why?What's wrong? His office has reported him missing. Oh,

 no. They did? And this morning, the coast guard found his empty

 boat floating in the y. Oh, my god. I hope this isn't...

 Last time i saw him, i to him i was leaving him.

 How did he react to that news? Well, he took it pretty

 hard. Oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you? Well,

 actually, we don't. You don't? When we examined the boat, we didn't

 find a single fingerprint, not even mr.Lang's. Well, that's weird. What--what do

 you think that means? It would indate somebody wiped that boat down

 after mr.Lang was... Gone. Whoever was on that boat is clearly not

 that bright. Okay, this is no time for name-calling. A man is

 missing. Well, don't worry, ma'am. We got our best men on this

 case, 'round the clock. We'll find out exactly what happened to your

 husband. Great. mom Went to mall with derek. Back late. I'm barrett.

 Is mike home? No, he's at work. Oh, shoot. I needed to

 talk to him. Wee, uh, just doing some business together. Well, i

 don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back

 later tonight. Oh, i can't do that. I have to study for

 an orgo test. Orgo? Organic chemistry. I'm pre-med. Pre-med? Really? Oh, hello,

 dear. Andrew, get orson's plate from the oven. Ask me how my

 morning was. All right. How was it? After two nights of sleepless

 bonding with my son, i nearly dozed off while repairing mrs. Colby's

 cracked molar. I doubt if the crown i put in will last

 her a year. So you'll replace it for free. That's not the

 point. How is a dentist supposed to feel when he can't give

 a 90-year-old a lifetime guarantee? Bree, i'm sorry, but this whole family

 bed thing has to stop. Oh, give it some time. We're still

 adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly. Well, he can sleep just

 as soundly in a crib. From what you've told me, you and

 rex didn't haul andrew into bed with you. No, and i wish

 we had. If we did, he mightn't have turned out so... So

 what? Stupid? Lazy? Short? I was going to say angry, and perhaps

 that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery. I'm just

 trying to learn from my mistakes. So i'm--i'm what, like the first

 pancake? Don't be so sensitive. We'll find something to help you sleep--

 maybe some warm milk. I know something that used to help me

 sleep. Of course, that's off the menu these days. Could the mistake

 have the salt? D if you're as tired as you say you

 are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight. Yes, i will, because

 i'll be sleeping in the den. You're leaving our bed? Darling, i

 need to either sleep or get lucky tonight. I'll have a better

 shot at both if i'm alone. Gosh, you're studying to be a

 doctor. That must not leave you a lot of free time for

 hobbies or... A girlfriend. Well, i have the time. I just don't

 have the girlfriend. Well, no rush. You know, just yesterday, i was

 telling my daughter julie-- oh, you know, that is so rude. I-i'm

 talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like.

 That's her. She's cute. Oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments. If

 i was... I would've shown you this one. Oh, excuse me. I'm

 sorry. I gotta take this. Oh, sure. I have to check on

 the laundry. Yeah? No, bonehead, i don't sell that stuff. Just pills,

 smokes and 'shroomage. That's it. 20 bucks, cash only. Meet y at

 the dorm. Look what i found on the dryer. Julie won second

 place in the state science fair. That's awesome. Yeah, good-looking and smart.

 Only problem is, where is she gna find someone else like that?

 Well, i gotta get going. My study partner's giving me a harde

 about that test, so... Oh, that's okay. You know, why don't you

 come back tomorrow to see me, and if julie happens to be

 here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges

 and stuff. Yeah, sounds great. See you tomorrow, mrs.Delfino. Oh, please, call

 me \"mom. \" uh, because... That's what all the kids call me.

 Oh, thank you. Hey, bree. Table for, uh, one and a half?

 No, thanks. I'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone. He forgot it

 again. Okay. I'll give it to him. Um, tom, may i ask

 you something? Did you and lynette do the family bed when your

 children were babies? Well, it wasn't exactly a choice. They just kept

 crawling in there. So, um, not to pry, but, um, did that

 create any, uh, issues for you? You mean sex? Apparently, \"not to

 pry\" wasn't necessary. Well, it did put a crimp on things at

 first, but that just forced us toe more creative. - Again, not

 to pry, but- - the office. We did it at the office,

 once in the car, and you remember when youasked us to wa

 when you guys were going out of town? Okay. Thanks. Yes, um,

 we'll be going now. Hey, other than your issue, how does orson

 like being a dad? Oh, he just adores it. The three of

 us are such a happy little family. Aren't we? That is great.

 - Bye. - Bye. - I replaced the gasket - Shouldn't leak

 anymore? Great... Why don't you grab us a couple beers? Sylvia. What

 are you doing here? Beautiful house. Look, you need to leave. I

 don't want katherine finding you here. Oh, but katherine's gone. I waited

 until she drove away so we could be alone. Aren't you gonna

 invite me in? After you ruined my life? I don't think so.

 You ruined your own life. You should have told the truth about

 us. Sylvia, why don't you do us both a favor and go

 back to chicago? Adam, let me in. Hey, man. Your, uh, your

 beer's getting warm. Oh, you have guests. Well, i guess i'll just

 drop by some other time. I'm sorry, man. It just sounded like

 you needed a little help. Thanks. That's, um, a-an ex-patient... With some

 pretty serious mental problems. Uh, could you do me a big favor?

 I'd rather katherine didn't know she was here. Yeah, that's no problem.

 You know, actually, i was gonna ask you a favor, too. I've

 got this pain in my shoulder. You--you think you could write me

 a prescription? Oh, i wish i could help you out, but a

 gynecologist writing a prescription for a man? It kind of raises a

 red flag. Ah, don't worry about it. This favor tng doesn't have

 to go both ways. Linda, is mrs.Zimmerman here? Hello, doctor. Bree. What

 a wonderful surprise. Uh, i've got a new patient coming in. Mmm,

 yes, you do. I'm mrs.Zimmerman. Uh, your message said you had a

 cavity that needed filling? I was in a very naughty mood when

 i left that. You're waiting outside. Why are you waiting outside? Everything

 is fine. It's just, um, someone's here. Oh, my god. It's the

 police? No, no. No, nothing like that. It's your stepfather. Glen? I

 don't believe it. Lynnie. Oh, it's been a long time. Oh, god.

 Only three decades give or take a year, but who cares? Oh,

 gosh. You look great. Oh, so do you, although what--what--what's this? Oh,

 just a little cancer. No, but i kicked its ass. I'm good

 now. You come here. Oh! So why--why are you here? Well... Your

 mother called me. She did? Is she okay? Uh, she sounds fine.

 She asked for money. - I didn't know you guys had kept

 in touch. - well, we had. I'm meeting her at fairview park

 to give it to her, and i'm guessing you'll want to come

 with me. Yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?

 She broke into a car and spent the night there. Oh, my

 god. But she did say it was a cadillac. Oh, well, good.

 At least she's not living like a hobo. Oh, my god. I'm

 so glad to see you again. Oh, you, too, lynnie. Hey, bree.

 Hello, adam. I just dropped by to see your husband. Is he

 here? He's in the exam room, readjusting the chair. Look, i'm sorry

 mike is in such pain, but it's not really ethical for me

 to write him a prescription. Know it's a little dicey, but you'd

 really be doing me a big favor. By the way, bree looks

 great. I haven't seen her since i delivered danielle's baby. Sorry. Your

 baby. Hey, andrew. What are you doing? Just giving you that sewing

 room you always wand. You're moving out? But you can't afford an

 apartment. I can afford this one, which will give you some idea

 how crappy the neighborhood is. I'm sorry. I don't--i don't understand. Why

 are you doing this? I'm doing this for you. How are you

 gonna get a fresh start with your past mistakes stinking up the

 place? Is this about the other morning? Oh, for heaven sakes, you

 can't be serious. I am. In fact, i already gave the landlord

 a check. So i hope the three of you are very happy.

 Well, to be honest, i'm not entirely comfortable giving this to you,

 mike. Pain medication only helps your symptoms. If this is chronic, you

 need to be seeing a physical therapist. You know what i need,

 orson? I need to take a few weeks off, but i can't,

 'cause i've got to work... For the baby, for julie's class trip,

 the patio furniture and everything else susan's got me paying for. Are

 you okay, mike? You sound a little unhappy. No, no, i'm happy,

 and i don't mean to put all of this on susan. It's

 just, when i signed up for this suburn dad thing, i didn't

 exactly know what i was getting myself into. No, i understand. Still,

 this is no way to deal with stress. It's not about stress.

 It's about the pain i've been in every day since i got

 hit by that car. You mean this pain is related to your

 accident? It wasn't an accident. Some son of a bitch ran me

 down and took off. Right. Well, i hope this helps. Oh, mike,

 you're home. I was dreaming we were ponies. That's nice. Go back

 to sleep. Hey, that kid, um, barrett me by today. What? Yeah,

 he said that you owed him money for some... Plumbing job that

 he helped you on. Yeah. Yeah, i gotta get that to him.

 Oh. He's coming back tomorrow. Don't you think he would be perfect

 for julie? Barrett, it's delfino. I'm only gonna say this once. I'll

 get you your money, but don't ever come to my house again.

 You got it? Ever. MAYOR MISSING Yes, hello. I'd, uh, like to

 leave an anonymous tip about something important. Uh, do you have some

 kind of voice mail menu for that? Well, it's about the mayor.

 Oh, i don't think he's missing. I think he's dead. Look, that's

 it. We gotta go to the cops. Carlos, please. Look, we blew

 it with the fingerprints, all right? Now they know someone else was

 with him on the boat. They don't know that someone else was

 us. It's just a matter of time. I mean, make a list

 of people with a motive to kill victor. Number one--you. Number two--you.

 Number three--maybe me, probably still you. Okay, if we just stay lm

 and stick to the story... We tried that. It's not working. I'm

 going to the cops. Now you can either come with me or

 wait for them to come and get you. Fine. I'll go. Thank

 you. Can we at least have a drink before we go? Calm

 our nerves? I mean, you can't talk to the cops the way

 you've been babbling to me. I guess one drink wouldn't hurt. You

 okay with tequila? Only if it's the good stuff! Oh, i think

 you'll find this has a real kick. SLEEPING AID Oh, and this

 is the worst. During a dissection, my anatomy lab partner squirted stomach

 juice in my eye. Ew.That is so disgusting. Oh, it was terrible.

 So gross. Hey. - What are you smiling about? - My matchmaking

 skills. Julie and barrett are really hitting it f. - Barrett? -

 Yeah, your friend. I told you last night he was coming by

 again. I appreciate all the pressure you're putting on me. You're welcome.

 Uh, julie, could you give us a minute? Barrett and i have

 a little business to discuss. Sure. I'll just grab my jacket. I

 thought i told you to stay away from my house. But your

 wife invited me. And, hey, you married into a cute family. Kudos.

 Here's your money. Now get out. We were just leaving. I'm taking

 julie on a tour of my campus. There is no way I'm

 no going anywhere with a lowlife drug dealer. Lowlife? Dude, i'm a

 pre-med student who's found an enterprising way to earn his way through

 college. You, on the other hand, are a junkie, and i don't

 think you want your cute family knowing that, do ya? I'll have

 her home by 10:00. - This is delicious, mrs.Delfino. - Thank you.

 Hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for

 you guys to take? This guy's a drug dealer. What? You remember

 those pills you found? He sold them to me. - Look, mrs.Delfino--

 - get out of my house. - Get him out of my

 house! - Okay. I'll go. It's a shame, though. He was such

 a good customer. Hey. Where'd barrett go? Why am i so sleepy

 all of a sudden? Oh, i don't know, but if you're not

 feeling well, maybe we should put this off. No, no, no. We

 gotta go now. Crap! What? Oh! Detectives! Any, uh, news on my

 husband? Not yet, but we've got some more questions for you. Oh,

 okay. So ask away. Mrs.Lang, were you having an affair with your

 ex-husband? Carlos? That's crazy. Where'd you hear that? Your neighbor called us.

 Oh. Well, you tell edie britt just because carlos dumped her, doesn't

 mean she has to go around trashing my reputatn, especially when she's

 the slut. Well, have you seen him lately? Boy, let me think

 Uh... Mm... No. No, i haven't. This is lyons. We're on our

 way. Good news, mrs.Lang. They found your husband. Huh? A couple of

 fishermen found him washed up on the beach. He's unconscious but in

 stable condition. Would you like to go to the hospital? Well, why

 wouldn't i? Just let me grab my purse. Well, you can stop

 feeling guilty. Victor's alive, and we're screwed. Okay, what's the plan? Once

 she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money. Then

 ask her to walk you back to the car. I'll jump out,

 grab her, and while you open the trunk... Lynette. Fine, the backseat,

 but you're just gonna spoil her. I see you still have that

 wicked sense of humor. Yeah. It's the one good thing you get

 from a crappy childhood. You know, i... I always regretted the way

 things ended. Why? Mom cheated on you. No one blames you for

 leaving. It was, uh, more complicated than that. - Hey, i'm not

 complaining. - Well-- ah, there's booze-illa now. All right, i'll go get

 her. He bought those pills a long time ago and never got

 around to paying the guy. Wow. Julie, it's not like it was

 heroin or crack. It was just pain pills for his shoulder, but

 we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them. -

 Are you absolutely sure? - Yeah. Why? Well, i was at the

 drugstore this morning, and i saw mike there, picking up a prescription.

 Hello, stella. Glen. What the hell? I know we're the same age.

 How is it you look so much better than me? - Well,

 i don't drink or sleep in cars - oh, so that's your

 secret. Who knew? Stell, here's the money. Thanks, doll. You are a

 beautiful, beautiful human being. You son of a bitch. You set me

 up. Lynette! Oh, crap! Now where do you think you're going? I'm

 off to die in a ditch. What do you care? Okay, ough

 with the drama. I want you to come home with me. Oh,

 really? That's not what you said to lydia and lucy. I am

 sorry about that, mom. We were just venting. People who love you

 need to do that. I was not a horrible mother. And even

 if I was, it'a all new, so drop it. Drop it? Do

 you hear that? She wants me to drop it. And when she

 cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, i bet she

 wanted you to drop that, too. Okay, guys-- what's done is done,

 and if you can't get over it, there's nothing i can say

 that'll make you stop hating me. There is one thing you could

 say. You keep your mouth shut. Stella, she's a grown woman. She

 can handle it. Handle what? Glen, don't. Lynnie... I didn't leave your

 mother because she cheated on me. I left because i'm gay. Mom.

 You okay? Just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your

 stairwell. May i come in? Oh, i'd--i'd kind of rather you not

 see the place until i get it fixed up. Well, i guess

 i'll just have to take my veal scaloppini and go home. I've

 been so busy with moving, i forgot to eat. - This is

 really good, mom. - Thank you. You know, i'd make it for

 every day if you'd move back home. Mom, this... This is my

 home. Seriously, andrew, you don't even have a bed. Actually, you're sitting

 on it. It's a foldout. Oh, dear god. At least let me

 buy you some decent furniture. Absolutely not. Mom, i'm-- i'm gonna do

 this on my own. Andrew, i understand you're angry with me about

 what i said, but... I do have a good reason for wanting

 to raise benjamin differently. I mean, let's be honest. You put me

 through hell. You're right. I-i know i did, but that's why i'm

 mad. Because i-i changed, and you never noticed. You know, i-i got

 a job, a car, my own health insurance. I'-- i've turned things

 around. Well, i know that. Then why haven't you said anything? It's

 because you've been so focused on your new husband and baby. -

 Oh, andrew. - Mom, it's okay. You know, you've got a new

 life, I think it's time to I did it too I just

 don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did

 two years ago. You mean when you left me on the side

 of that road? Look, mom... I was spinning out of control. You

 forced me to grow up. If i haven't said it before, thank

 you. You forgive me? I forgave you a long time ago. You

 just... You just never noticed. Oh, uh, mom? Uh, would you mind

 using a coaster? Okay. Now i... I really am gonna cry. Dave

 passed away last spring. We were together almost 20 years. Oh. He

 seems nice. I know it's a lot to deal with. Kinda. So,

 uh, coffee's probably ready. Uh, cream and sugar? Shot of bourbon? Why

 didn't you tell me? It wasn't my proudest moment, lynette. What are

 you talking about? I failed as a woman. Two years being married

 to me, and he turns gay. I don't think that's how it

 works. All i know is i was... So ashamed. What does it

 matter anyway? It wouldn't have changed anything between us. Are you kidding?

 It would've changed everything. Oh, y-you would've given me a pass on

 my drinking and my--my swearing, my--my men? If i understood why you

 couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent i'd

 ever known, yeah, i could've found a way to forgive you all

 sorts of things. We can talk about this later. Let's go home.

 I don't think so. Listen to me. I would be honored if

 you would come and live with us. Having you around these past

 few months was sort of... Fun. It was great. We actually figured

 out a way to stop torturg each other. Then why not come

 back? Because i don't want to screw that up, and let's face

 it, lynette. You know i would. So why don't we just take

 our chips and leave the table winners? But where will you live?

 Actually, i have a thought. Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

 but, um... I happen to have an immaculately decorated guest room. You

 know, he's always talked like that. How did i not know you

 were queer? I'm sorry.You want this aroun well, we always had a

 good time, and to tell the truth, i've been a little lonely

 lately. Oh. So i would be doing you a favor. Fine, but

 i'm keeping the money. It's a deal. Does this work for you?

 It does. It really does. Some stretches, and the shoulder feels great.

 That's a relief. You, uh, gonna take a shower? Yeah. I might,

 um, go down for a snack in a minute. Okay. Mrs.Lang? Uh,

 i'm dr.Wheeler, your husband's neurologist. How is he? Uh, he's starting to

 wake up now. Would you like to talk to him? Of course!

 I-i bet he's pretty delirious. I mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't

 be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person! Mr.Lang, your

 wife is here. Gaby. Hi. Don't strain yoursel victor. There's plenty of

 time to talk later. Wh's important now is that you rest. Just

 stay quiet and rest... Quietly. Mr.Mayor, i'm detective berry. We need to

 ask you a few questions. What time did you take your boat

 out? I was on the boat? We think. We found it floating

 in the bay, and, uh, obviously, you'd been in the water for

 quite some time. Uh, the last thing i remember... Was friday's staff

 meeting. Really? I mean, what? Gaby, do you remember anythi about me

 being on the boat? No. No. Sorry. I guess i don't remember

 anything. Not uncommon in these situations. He's suffered both a mild concussion

 and hypothermia, either of which could result in memory loss. Well, who

 cares? The important ing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nue

 you back to health, and i think that would happen a lot

 faster if we all clear out. Thank you. Gaby, can you stay

 with me for a little while? Of course. Sounds like i was

 in pretty bad shape there. But you're okay now. That's the important

 thing. Come here. I remember everything. What? I think i will rest

 now. I'm gonna need all my strength. The past is never truly

 behind us. Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to remind us of

 the choices we made. But if we look back, we might find

 an old friend with open arms... Or an old enemy with a

 hidden agenda. Or a grown-up son with a forgiving heart... Sadly, some

 of us refuse to look back, never understanding that by denying the
