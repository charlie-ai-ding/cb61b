 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives. - Gabby discovered a secret. Your stomach just kicked

 me. I want you to run the Miami office. So Carlos played

 hardball. You can't fire me for being pregnant. I'm offering you a

 promotion. If you choose to turn it down and quit instead, I

 can't stop you. Katherine broke down. The man I love chose you.

 It's over. Why has this been so hard on me? You loved

 him. I found a way to spring you from this marriage. Karl

 had a plan. If he violates parole by associating with a known

 felon, they can revoke it. All we need to do is get

 some ex-con in a room with Orson, take some pictures, and it's

 bye-bye, Orson. That's perfect! And then he'll have to let me go!

 Nick made a call. Agent Padilla? I'm thinking about coming in. And

 evil... Did you forget something? ...returned to the neighborhood. What are you

 doing? Her name was Emily Portsmith, and word of her death spread

 quickly. You see, everyone in town knew Emily. Her family was well-known

 and respected. She'd been popular in school. And her customers at the

 coffee shop adored her. People were shocked to hear she'd been murdered,

 mostly because another young woman had been attacked just a few weeks

 before. Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew a killer was walking among

 them. And they would soon learn he wasn't finished. The next day,

 the women of Wisteria Lane got together for their weekly poker game.

 But as it turned out, no one was in the mood to

 gamble. The girl at the coffee shop was strangled, and Julie was

 attacked the same way. There is obviously a madman on the loose.

 I'm afraid to leave my house at night. At least now you

 have a boyfriend to protect you. Roy? The man threw out his

 back peeling an orange. I'm on my own here. So, what do

 we do to protect ourselves? Down at the hospital where I work,

 they offer a self-defense class. - Maybe we should consider taking that.

 - That's a good idea. I guess we could, but you know

 my motto, \"A.38 Special is a girl's best friend.\" Ooh! I love

 the pearl handle. It would look so good with my white suit.

 Susan, you should feel it. It's so light. I don't touch guns

 anymore. Not since I accidentally grazed Katherine. Still going with \"accidentally,\" are

 we? Oh, hey, honey. We're all going to take a self-defense class.

 - You want to come with us? - Yeah, it might make

 you feel safer. Well, I was taking out the trash when I

 was attacked. He came out of nowhere. And I blacked out before

 I knew what was happening. If someone really wants to get you,

 they can get you. I'm off. Oh, you're sewing Penny's costume? Yeah,

 but I'm reading the sports page while doing it, so they kind

 of cancel each other out. Oh, I got you this, pricey bourbon.

 It's 8:45 in the morning, and I'm pregnant. I think I'll pass.

 For Carlos. It's a \"Sorry I lied about being pregnant\" gift. I

 don't need that. I know Carlos. He loses his temper, then he

 calms down and thinks rationally. - Goodbye. - I'd still bring the

 booze. I'm telling you, I'm too valuable right where I am. There's

 no way he's going to try and send me to Florida. Bon

 voyage! What's going on? Carlos told us about the promotion in Florida.

 Congratulations! You are going to be so missed around here. Lynette, where

 are you going? Rita wrote you a goodbye poem. Can I see

 you in my office, please? What do you think you're doing? You

 know I'm not moving to Florida. Okay, so then we just change

 the banner to read, \"Good luck and so long!\" No. It needs

 to read, \"I told you I'm not leaving. Someone get me a

 bagel.\" Lynette, what can I tell you? We have an opening for

 you in our Florida branch. But here, your job's already been given

 to Tim. Well, tell Tim you made a mistake. I can't do

 that. So, I guess this leaves you no choice but to quit.

 Look, I know what you are doing and I am not going

 for it. You want me gone, you're going to have to fire

 me. And open myself up to a lawsuit by firing a pregnant

 woman? I don't think so. Then if you don't mind, I have

 work to do. Hey. These aren't my kids. No, those are Tim's

 kids. This is his office now. So, what office will I be

 using? Are you kidding me? These twins have a bigger office. Enjoy.

 How're you doing? I'm okay. Everybody seems to think whoever killed Emily

 was probably the same person who attacked me. Yeah, that's what the

 police are saying. And I think that we should do everything we

 can to help them. Meaning what? Maybe now is the time to

 tell them about the married man you were seeing. - He had

 nothing to do with it. - You don't know that. Men who

 cheat sometimes have more than one girlfriend. Mom, listen! There is no

 way he could ever hurt someone, much less kill them. Okay. -

 If you're sure. - I am. I mean, why would he attack

 me and then want to get back together? Wait. Have you started

 seeing him again? - No. - Julie. Even if I did, it

 is my life, right? That's right. It is your life. Now, is

 it just me, or was life much less complicated when you were

 seven? Sorry I grew up. Me, too. Police are concerned that the

 strangling of Portsmith is connected to a similar attack on a Fairview

 woman earlier this year. Anyone with information is being asked to call.

 Just think, if the cops hadn't wasted so much time on Danny,

 they might've caught this guy before he did this again, right? What?

 I was there. - You were where? - At the coffee shop.

 I got there right when that girl was closing up. Oh, please

 be kidding. Nah, I wish I was. But I'm pretty sure I

 was her last customer. Well, did anybody see you? No, I don't

 think so. But that doesn't mean the cops won't figure out that

 I was there. And if they do... Yeah, they're going to want

 to come and talk to you again, - and maybe run your

 prints. - Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was also thinking

 that maybe we shouldn't wait around - for that to happen. -

 No. - I'm not moving again. Not this time. - Look, Angie...

 Angie... - Angie, would you just let me finish? - Nick, I

 like this place! I have friends, I have a job. I feel

 like a real person here again. After 18 years of being a

 ghost, I don't want to give that up. Fine. Well, maybe we'll

 get lucky and the cops just won't come. But honestly, I don't

 know how much more luck we've got left. Hey... Hello, are you

 Lamar Benjamin? - You got a warrant? - Oh, no, I'm not

 with the police. My name is Bree Hodge. You know my husband

 Orson from the state penitentiary. Do you have a moment? I got

 nothing but moments. So, you're Mrs. Hodge? Damn, Flossy did okay for

 himself. \"Flossy\"? That's what we called Orson because he got us all

 dental floss, then nagged us to use it after every meal. I

 see. Pain in the ass. I was glad when somebody used it

 to strangle a guard and they took it all away. So how's

 Orson doing? Well, to be honest, Lamar, life on the outside's been

 a little hard for him. People can be so judgmental about men

 who have served time. And if you're a repeat offender, you can

 forget it. Yes, well. I've heard Orson speak very fondly of his

 prison friends, especially you. Really? Because he seemed kind of mad after

 I used him as a shield in that yard fight. Lamar, he

 just tells that story now and laughs and laughs! Anyway, he's been

 feeling a little blue, and I was hoping you would pay him

 a visit and cheer him up. Sorry. I'd be breaking my parole.

 They catch me hanging out with other ex-cons, they can send me

 back to jail. Really? Well, that's a silly rule. Don't worry, though,

 our house is on the end of a very quiet cul-de-sac. No

 one would even know you stopped by. And of course I would

 compensate you for your time. And another three when you come. Then

 what the hell? No harm in a little social call. But you

 can't tell anybody I came. When you get to know me better,

 Lamar, you'll find I have no trouble keeping secrets. - Hey, what

 are you doing here? - Your mom told me you were upset.

 I told her I knew how to make you feel better. Mint

 chocolate chip? Thanks, Daddy. I know this one's going to take a

 lot more than ice cream. I keep thinking about him. He's out

 there. - And maybe he's thinking about me. - Honey, honey, he's

 not. He knows where I live, he knows what kind of car

 I drive. I've been wanting to go to the library, but I'm

 afraid he's going to follow me. Look, if you're worried about your

 car, why don't we switch for a while? Seriously? I drive your

 fancy car and you drive my tiny little compact? Hey, there's nothing

 I would not do for my little... You have air conditioning, right?

 Yeah, there's nothing I wouldn't do for my little girl. You okay?

 I'm just having a bad day. My life's gotten sort of complicated.

 Why? Oh, it's grown-up relationship stuff. You wouldn't understand. - Okay. -

 But... Since you asked... So, I think you're really going to have

 fun at Brandon's party. I heard there's going to be a pony.

 - Hey, you okay? - I'm worried about Mrs. Mayfair. - Why?

 - She's not getting any younger. And it's really hard to meet

 guys in this town. - Where did you hear that? - She

 told me. She also said Mommy stole you from her and that

 makes Mommy a bad person. Buddy, your mommy is a great person.

 Now why don't you sign Brandon's card, okay? And I'll be right

 back. Mike, watch it! Did you actually tell my 6-year-old son that

 his mother's a bad person? Well, I would've used more colorful language,

 but like you said, he's only six. You've never really seen me

 get angry. But if you want to, just talk to my son

 one more time. Then you'll know what I'm capable of. Mike, I

 love MJ. I would never do anything to hurt him. One more

 time. Oh, Julie... No! - Hello. - Hi, it's your mother. -

 Am I interrupting anything? - No, I'm just at the library. Oh,

 really? The library... Yeah, I thought I'd dive into an old favorite.

 - And vice versa, I'm sure. - Huh? Honey, I don't blame

 you. You've gone back to that place because it seems safe and

 comforting. Am I right? I guess. - But trust me, it's a

 bad idea. - Can we talk about this later? I only have

 an hour and I really want to finish. Okay, I want you

 out of there right now! Mom, I'll see you soon. You bet

 you will. You've been a busy girl! You got the ex-con booked,

 hidden cameras all set up. Come Friday night, showtime! So what's the

 matter? We should be celebrating. I just hope we're both clear that

 these photos are strictly for blackmail. Of course. We're not actually going

 to send him to prison. Unless, I mean, we have to. No,

 Karl, even if he calls our bluff, we are not going to

 turn him in. Excuse me, I'm looking for the person that belongs

 to the little blue car. - She's a redhead... - With a

 man? Yeah, she's with a man. The redhead's my daughter. Your daughter?

 Damn, you look good. Thank you. So, can you tell me what

 room they're in? I may not love him anymore, but I'm not

 going to win my freedom by taking away his. Now you're angry.

 Bree, when you tell me you could never hurt a man you

 used to love, it doesn't make me angry. It just reminds me

 why I love you so much. Don't you worry. No one's going

 to get hurt. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hey, Eric. Can

 you tell Carlos I'm here for lunch? - I'm going to run

 to the ladies' room. - I'll tell him. Hi, Lynette. Hi, Gabby.

 I'd ask you in, but I don't think there's enough oxygen in

 here for the both of us. No, it's comfy. Hey. I get

 that Carlos is trying to punish me, but enough is enough. You've

 got to talk to him. Lynette, you never even came to me

 to tell me you were pregnant. - I think this is between

 you and Carlos. - Okay, I know you're upset, but me keeping

 my pregnancy secret wasn't personal. - Wasn't it? - No! Listen to

 me. Tom and I are still in debt. I needed this promotion.

 And Carlos had already passed over a coworker because she was pregnant.

 I couldn't risk you telling him. Because you thought I'd tell Carlos

 - and he'd fire you. - Yes. So, clearly I wasn't enough

 of a friend for you to trust me. No. But now I'm

 such a good friend, I'm the only one who can fix it

 for you? I'm guessing you're not going to talk to Carlos. Good

 guess. I can't believe she's dead. I know. I just saw her

 a few days ago. We talked about going to the mall. Who

 found her? The assistant manager. I was late yesterday. I mean, thank

 God, it would've freaked me out. - Hey. - Hi. We were

 just talking about Emily. Yeah. I didn't really know her, but I

 guess we're sort of connected now. You would have liked her. She

 was super nice. I gotta go home. My mom's so freaked out

 that this could've been me, she wants me around. I'll give you

 a ride. - We should go, too, Danny. - No, you go

 ahead. But don't you need a ride? No, I'll walk. I just

 want to talk to Julie. Thanks. - So, you want to get

 something to eat? - Thanks, but I'm not hungry. Well, maybe you

 want to go to Emily's funeral together? Everybody's going. Danny, I know

 you like me. But I can't hang out with you. - Why

 not? - I just can't. It's complicated. It's because you slept with

 my dad, isn't it? - Who told you that? - I figured

 it out a while ago. If you know that, then why in

 the world - would you still... - Because I like you a

 lot. Do you not see how weird that is? No, it's okay,

 because I've forgiven you. That's nice, but it's still weird. Julie, please,

 I want to be with you. Danny, I'm so sorry. But that

 is never going to happen. Come on, if they're going to come,

 they're going to come. I feel like I spent my entire life

 looking out windows. Yeah. - Maybe it's time we stop. - What

 are you saying? I'm saying, maybe it's time we thought about coming

 in. Please tell me you didn't talk to them. Oh, my God.

 All right, calm down, all right? I'm not an idiot. I used

 a pre-paid, and the call lasted less than a minute. There's no

 way they're ever going to find us. But still, they know we're

 alive. Don't you want to know if they're ready to make a

 deal? I killed a man. They'll be ready to make a deal

 when I got a needle in my arm and my eyes are

 rolled back in my head! Come on, you don't know that. You

 are never talking to them again! Do you hear me? I still

 can't get that image of Lynette out of my head. The only

 thing missing in that cramped little office was a hamster wheel and

 wood chips. Yeah, I figure a couple more days of this, she'll

 be ready to pack her things. She does deserve this, right? She

 lied when she took the promotion. What if her doctor had put

 her on bed rest? What if I needed her to fly somewhere?

 She could have put the whole company in jeopardy. Yeah, but that

 never happened. And you said she was doing a good job. And

 now you're doing all these mean things to her. Me? This was

 your idea. You wanted to put snakes in her office. Rubber snakes.

 We are completely justified here. You're right. You're right, which is why

 we have the opportunity to do something we never do, Carlos, forgive.

 Seriously? Tom and Lynette have been our friends for 15 years. They

 gave us sausage-of-the-month last Christmas. Those were good sausages. I know Lynette.

 She would never set out to intentionally hurt us. I've got to

 admit, I do sort of miss those guys. You should have seen

 her when I was leaving her office. She had this look in

 her eyes. She was so defeated. You should have seen this look

 in her eyes. - It was like, \"Screw you, Lynette. I win.\"

 - So, that's when you called the lawyer? Hell, yes. They're not

 getting away with this. They are not going to harass me. I

 am going to sue their ass. And Carlos is being served papers

 tomorrow. Wow. You're really getting worked up here. - We are not

 having angry sex. - Just thought I'd ask. What did I tell

 you about putting away those clothes? I'm serious. Nap time's over! Danny?

 Danny! No, no, no, no, no! Nick! Any woman can be the

 victim of a violent crime. That is why it's necessary to learn

 how to defend yourself. A parking lot, a park, your own driveway...

 An attack can happen anywhere. It only takes a few seconds. Sorry

 I'm late. I had three parties to prep for. How tiring that

 must be for you juggling all those affairs. Okay, everyone team up.

 I want an attacker and a victim. Hey, Gabby, you want to

 attack me? Mrs. McCluskey, I don't want to hurt you. Please, I've

 eaten burgers bigger than you are. Bring it on. All right, Granny,

 prepare to break a hip. So, looks like we're partners. Do you

 want to attack me? I could be persuaded. Now, attackers, I want

 you to approach your victim. Hey! Freakishly strong old lady here. I

 credit the bran. Well, that's very impressive. But the rest of you,

 approach your victim from behind, place her in a choke hold. Now,

 victim, your impulse will be to pull away. Wrong, you'll just choke

 harder. Instead, I want you to push back on your attacker, using

 your weight to push him off balance. - Susan, a little tight.

 - Oh, I'm sorry. Ouch! Feels bad, huh? Being betrayed by someone

 you trusted not to hurt you? - What are you talking about?

 - I know about you and Karl. - Oh, no. - Oh,

 yeah. Traitor! Stop it! You can't talk your way out of an

 attack. Jab with your elbows! I am trying! How could you? You

 know how Karl treated me! Susan, I'm sorry! If you'll let me

 explain... Okay, now, attacker and victim, switch. - You heard him, switch!

 - No. I am not letting you get behind me! You've already

 stabbed me in the back! - Mrs. Delfino, release your victim. -

 She is not the victim here! What about Orson? How could you

 do this to him? You know nothing about my marriage to Orson!

 Orson has put me through hell this year! - Bree, too tight!

 - Susan, I know you're angry, but Karl means more to me

 than just a fling, and I am not giving him up. So,

 if that means our friendship is over, then that's your decision, not

 mine. You're going? We just got started. I know. But I think

 I've defended myself enough for one day. - Hey. - Hey. I

 just got a call from the lawyer. They're going to be serving

 Carlos any minute. Wow. You're really going through with this, huh? Yeah.

 We're not bad people, are we, Tom? What Carlos is doing to

 you is totally unfair and illegal. No, we're good people. Right. He

 started it. Screw him. Yoo-hoo! Hey. What's all this? Candy, flowers, baby

 gift. It's sort of my way of saying \"I'm sorry, and here's

 some crap to prove it.\" - Really? - Yeah. I don't want

 to fight anymore, and neither does Carlos. I was hoping we could

 talk. Gabby! I'm so happy. Aw! Here, take it. It's getting heavy.

 I missed you. Um, Lynette? Honey, we're having a moment here. Please

 don't spoil it. I'm not what's going to spoil it. Oh! Could

 you hold on a second? I'm just... I'm going to make a

 quick phone call. You know what, guys, I don't care what happens.

 Let's not let anything interfere with our friendship ever again. Remember you

 said that. Answer the phone. Answer the phone. What? It's Carlos. I

 wonder what he wants? Gabby, you know what you said about our

 friendship before? - Let's just make a pact that we should... -

 Hey, babe, what's up? - I will never forgive you for this.

 - Gabby, please! What about our pact? We never made a pact.

 Here, MJ, catch! You have to understand, I was just protecting myself.

 - Hello, ladies. What's new? - Lynette is suing Carlos! Here. Once

 you apologized, I tried to call the guy off. Lynette, you wanted

 to sue us. That proves that you are not my friend. -

 Hey, Karen! Here's some candy. - Trying to cut down. Really, at

 your age? Why bother? Please, I need to talk to you. No,

 you need to talk to my lawyer. Hey, Lynette, I've got a

 project for you. Okay. Who's this? Steve Matthews from legal. You know,

 since we all seem to be lawyering up around here. Look, I

 was just trying to protect myself. No, it's just business. This is

 the department's purchases and expenses from the last fiscal year. - I'm

 going to need all of that itemized. - Done. By tomorrow morning,

 9:00 a.m. I hate it when I'm the only one laughing. This

 is at least two days' work. Not if you work tonight. Penny's

 Christmas pageant is tonight. You know that. You go every year. Lynette,

 are you telling me that you're unable to... What was it again?

 \"Unable to perform the assigned task in a timely manner.\" Yeah, that's

 it. No. Tell your undertaker friend that I will get the assignment

 done - in a timely manner. - Great. And will you tell

 Penny Gabby and I are going to have to miss her pageant

 this year, and we are so sorry? Thank you both for coming.

 Before we get started, can I get you anything? Given what you're

 about to do to us, I'll take a cigarette and a blindfold.

 No, no, no, no. I have decided to put aside my rage

 and sense of betrayal. I'm here to help you. - Really? -

 Not you. If you are actually considering having a serious relationship with

 this man, then I want to make sure that you have all

 the facts. - What kind of facts? - Karl facts. Karl, tell

 Bree what you got me for my 30th birthday. Who can remember?

 It was so long ago. Nothing. He got me nothing because he

 forgot my birthday. - And it wasn't that long ago. - I

 don't see the point of... Now tell her where you spent our

 10th anniversary. I'm sorry, what was that? - A strip club. -

 Oh, Karl. That's nothing. Now tell her what you wanted for your

 35th birthday. Come on! He wanted me to ask a friend to

 join us in the bedroom. You kept saying I was hard to

 shop for. There he is, Bree. That is the man you say

 you want to be with. Susan, I went into this with my

 eyes wide open. I know who Karl was and who he sometimes

 still is. But I believe him when he says he wants to

 change. And isn't that what you're supposed to do when you love

 someone? Did you say \"love\"? I think I did. Bree, I have

 to ask you one question. - Are you drinking again? - No!

 Okay! Okay, I was just checking. Well, if that's really the way

 you feel, then you should be with him. And you have my

 blessing. Really? You can forgive me, just like that? You know, I

 was doing a lot of thinking since yesterday. And I realized that

 it's hard to find love. And when you do, you should grab

 it, and who cares what anybody thinks. And I really do want

 you to be as happy as I am with Mike. Oh! Thank

 you, Susan. Don't worry, Susie-Q. I'm going to do right by her.

 You really think you can change? Well, it's easy when you've found

 a woman worth changing for. I didn't mean... Ow, ow, ow! I

 learned that in self-defense class. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, Mom. -

 Bye-bye! - Okay, we're taking off. - Okay. - Wish your little

 angel luck. Good luck, sweetie. Now remember, your dad's going to videotape

 your pageant and we're all going to watch it tomorrow. Sweetie, I'm

 sorry. You know I'd be there, but... You have to work. It's

 okay. Hey, guys, wait up! The doctor is putting him under observation

 for 72 hours. It's standard procedure for... A suicide attempt. It's okay,

 Mona. Thanks for everything. My baby. What were you thinking, huh? I'm

 sorry I called the Feds. I was just trying to make your

 life easier after all the things I've done to make it harder.

 I mean, look what I've done to this kid. November 10th, 1991.

 It rained all day, remember? Mmm-hmm. We went to the diner before

 we went to meet up with the others. I had pumpkin pancakes.

 You didn't have anything. I had coffee. I forgot my umbrella in

 the booth. And then, eight hours later, neither of us existed anymore.

 I had to run. But you didn't. You gave up a hell

 of a lot just so I wouldn't be alone. I'd do it

 again. I'd do anything for you guys. - I hope you know

 that. - I do. Good morning, Lynette. It's 9:00. Got my reports?

 Almost. - So are you telling me you're not done? - I

 just need one more hour. Lynette, if only I needed them by

 10:00. Unfortunately, I told you that I needed them by 9:00. -

 Was I not clear? - You were crystal clear. It was impossible

 to get all this work done in a night, Carlos. You knew

 that when you gave it to me. Well, it wouldn't have been

 impossible if you had skipped your daughter's pageant. I know you went.

 Anyway, this is very painful for me, but I have no other

 choice but to terminate your employment. - You're really going to do

 this? - I believe I'm within my legal rights. You need to

 clear out your personal belongings within the hour, Mrs. Scavo. I was

 up all night on this. That's a shame. So, Mr. Matthews has

 some paperwork for you to sign. You're going to regret this. I'm

 not going to go quietly. I don't care how you go. I

 just want you gone. Oh, good. You're up. I'm Mona Clark. I

 live down the street from you and your folks. I told them

 I would take real good care of you. - Would you like

 some juice, Danny? - Tyler. What? It's not Danny. My name's Tyler.

 Bye, girls, thanks for coming. - Mike, what are you doing here?

 - I'm here to pick up MJ. But she said you couldn't

 make it. She was picking him up for you. - Who, Susan?

 - No, your neighbor Katherine. What? Did I do something wrong? MJ!

 Hi, Daddy. I drove by Eileen's and I saw my little buddy

 standing out there. He looked so forlorn. MJ, go home. I figured

 you were late at some job, so I thought I'd do you

 a favor. Now! What did I tell you? I needed to talk

 to him, Mike. He deserves to know the truth. His mother lies

 to him. He needs to know that what you and I had

 was real. You and I had nothing. - How can you say

 that? - It's true. The whole time I was with you, all

 I thought about was Susan. Every time I held you, every time

 I kissed you, all I was thinking was, \"God, I wish you

 were Susan.\" If you mean it, then please kill me. It would

 be less painful. I don't care enough about you to kill you.

 The world is a dangerous place. And we must learn to defend

 ourselves from those who want to hurt us. That stranger without a

 name. An employer who holds a grudge. The husband who won't let

 go. Yes, we all try to defend ourselves so we won't get

 hurt. Yes, I need an ambulance right away. 4356, Wisteria Lane. Please

 hurry, I'm losing a lot of blood. Until we realize our pain
