 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: Ian's wife Jane passed away... ... Gabby

 made a new friend... A friend friend, not a girlfriend. The finger

 of guilt... - I think it's a phone number. - ... pointed

 toward Mike. They tested my wrench and found traces of this Monique's

 blood. But he still couldn't remember. Bree found a bag of evidence.

 We have to do something. Not until we put these back in

 her house. Orson had a night... - What do you want? -

 A grandchild. ... he'd soon rather forget. - You raped my husband.

 - I could be expecting right now. Ah! [Mary Alice] It'd been

 two months since Mike Delfino awakened from his coma, and the memories

 he had lost were finally starting to return. He could now recall

 the first time he saw Wisteria Lane... ... and the first time

 he met his new neighbors... ... and the first time he heard

 Susan Mayer laugh. [laughing] But the memory he most wanted to reclaim

 still eluded him. That's why he had gone to see a hypnotherapist,

 so that he could finally remember everything. I thought you'd never get

 here. I'm sorry. The traffic was terrible. Oops! Sorry about that. I

 called my landlord when the pipe started leaking, and he recommended you.

 I was so flustered I couldn't find a piece of paper. I

 wrote your number on my hand. After you finish the sink maybe

 you could help me wash it off. Look... I'm flattered, but I'm

 seeing somebody. Me too... ...but he's married and I'm drunk. Your, uh,

 S trap is cracked. I don't have one with me. I'll have

 to go to the hardware store. - Now? It's late. - That

 water is gonna keep seeping, cause a lot more damage. - I'll

 be back in an hour. - I'll be waiting. Miss Poulier? I,

 uh... got that part for the sink. Hello? What happened, Mike? -

 God, I almost had it. I was so close. - Close to

 what? When I went back to Monique's place somebody else was there.

 - Who? - I don't know. I couldn't see it. [Mary Alice]

 Yes, there were still many things Mike Delfino couldn't remember. Then why

 are you smiling? But he'd finally remembered the most important thing of

 all... 'Cause now I know I didn't kill her. [Mary Alice] It

 was 6:00 in the morning, and Bree Hodge was faced with a

 dilemma familiar to countless housewives. Should she wake her husband to discuss

 recent events that were weighing heavily on her mind? Or should she

 let him continue to get the rest he needed? Bree made the

 obvious choice. I'm sorry, but you've been out cold for ten hours

 and we need to talk. I remember drinking the Scotch, and then

 Alma suddenly sitting up. But after that... nothing. Oh, dear. I'm not

 sure how to tell you this, but after Alma knocked you out,

 she assaulted you. - Where? - Sexually. - She had sex with

 you. - That's impossible. Your drink was laced with pills for... erectile

 dysfunction. But I was dead to the world. No, dear, you were

 dead to the waist. I had sex with Alma and I wasn't

 even conscious? How reminiscent of our marriage. OK, this is no joke.

 She raped you and your mother helped. After we dress we're going

 to the police. - I can't do that. - Orson, I know

 you're embarrassed, but what they did to you was a crime. I

 can't go to the police. Not now, not ever. Orson! Your ex-wife

 is a homicidal rapist, and your mother is straight out of I,

 Claudius. Why do you refuse to deal with them? I think it's

 time I told you about the night Monique Poulier died. - What

 do you think of this one? - Pretty sexy. Is sexy what

 you're going for at the funeral of your boyfriend's wife? You're right.

 I'll keep looking. Why are you going? Won't it be weird? No,

 it'll be fine. Ian wants me there. Yeah, but it'll be all

 of Jane's friends and family, and you'll be the other woman who

 swooped in... OK, yes, it'll be weird, but it's not about me.

 This is about Jane and Ian. What if I wear this one?

 Then it'll be about Jane, Ian and your boobs. I have got

 to get more depressing clothes. OK, I just need to keep a

 low profile through the memorial. 'Cause once I get through this, Ian

 can officially introduce me as his girlfriend, and we'll finally be a

 normal, non-adulterous couple. - What does this one say to you? -

 Modest, reserved, and definitely not dating the dead lady's husband. Sold. I'm

 not gonna get you towels for your birthday. Let's go to the

 jewelry department. No, Zach. I only accept jewelry from men I plan

 on sleeping with. Well, OK, so where does that leave me? You

 can buy me that toilet seat cover. Fine. I... We're just friends.

 Can I at least take you out for a birthday dinner? There

 will be no celebration. I'm turning 31. I'm a single woman in

 her thirties. I now have to subscribe to Cat Fancy. It's the

 law. Age is just a number. It doesn't mean anything. It means

 something to me. Being alone at this age, it's... hard, and it's

 only gonna get harder. I'm so depressed. Let me buy you a

 car. No thanks. But I do need a liquid soap dispenser. Go.

 Hello. Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to disturb you. I was just trying

 to see whether or not this was a regular king or a

 California king. I think it's a regular. California kings are much longer.

 Is your wife particularly tall? Oh, I'm, uh... I'm not married. -

 Oh. Why don't you try it out? - It's OK. I can

 wait until you get off. That'll happen a lot faster if you

 just hop on board. I'm sorry? It was a shameless sex joke.

 I was flirting with you. Oh! Right. [laughs] - Sorry, I can

 be a little dense. - [giggles] - Can we start over? -

 No. Moment's gone. You killed it. You know, I'm in a bit

 of a hurry, but maybe we can try this again sometime. -

 It could happen. - Hey. Sorry it took so long. - Mr.

 Young? - Oh, you know my \"friend\" Zach? No, I don't think

 so. I'm Luke... Purdue. I'm on your legal team. I'm taking point

 on the Halverson deal. Right. Hey. Again, it was nice meeting you.

 Sir. That was really weird. I don't even know the guy, and

 he works for me. Works for me, too. - Bree... - Please

 don't touch me. All this time you've said you wanted the truth.

 That's before I knew what it was. You see, that's why I've

 tried to protect you from this. Yeah, but you weren't just trying

 to protect me, were you? - What do you want me to

 do? - Exonerate Mike. How could you stand by and let an

 innocent man - be dragged off to prison? - Think I haven't

 felt terrible? After he'd been in a coma because some lunatic ran

 him over. He has had a rough year. I want to help

 Mike. How do I do that without implicating myself? I could go

 to jail. I don't care if you go to jail. You have

 done a horrible thing and you have to make it right. I

 mean it, Orson. If you don't fix this, I will. Well, I

 guess I'm in no position to argue. No, you're not. - Morning,

 Andrew. - Hey, Orson. I was just gonna ask if you guys

 wanted some coffee. Oh, yeah, thanks. I could use some. It's gonna

 be a long day. - Thank you. - Thanks. Thank you. [ice

 cream truck music plays] Mom! Dinner is in an hour. You know

 the rules. And so do you. I know, I know, but he

 gave me the face. You fell for the face. What are you,

 a rookie? OK, you're right. Sorry, buddy. Mom's the boss. I feel

 nothing. Hi, Lynette. Hey, Tom. How's the restaurant coming? Ready for the

 big opening? Oh, we're getting there. Let me give you a coupon.

 Free extra topping on any medium or large. How nice. But you

 know what would be even nicer? Hire my nephew to work for

 you. You know, the coupon's good all week. I don't know what

 lies you've heard about Austin. You can't be listening to vicious gossip.

 I heard he got arrested for beating some guy up. OK, that

 one's pretty accurate. - Edie, I'm all staffed up. - Oh, come

 on, help me out. Seriously. Ever since Julie dumped him he's been

 depressed and mopey. He's driving me crazy. Please! Any crappy job you

 got. Well, I guess I could use an extra guy in back.

 Have him there tomorrow, 8:00 in the morning. Thank you. Thank you

 so, so much. Edie, you forgot your coupon. Oh, Tom, please. You've

 checked out my butt enough times to know I don't eat pizza.

 [doorbell rings] Zach. You said you wanted to be alone for your

 birthday, but that's just dumb. - So I'm gonna take you out.

 - Oh, that's so sweet, but I... Don't worry. It's gonna be

 one friend keeping another friend company. It's not gonna be a date.

 Well, um, Luke's gonna be here in 20 minutes, and that kind

 of will be a date. Luke? Uh... - My lawyer guy? -

 Yeah. That isn't a problem, is it? 'Cause this is what friends

 do, they talk about each other's dates. No, I'm cool. Have a

 great time. Uh, I'm gonna get out of your hair. So you

 think this guy's really into you? Well, he seemed to like me

 in the mattress department, so here's hoping I like him in the

 mattress department. [laughs] What? Friends say these things. [knocking on door] Orson.

 Oh, well, I'm in luck. The whole coven is here. I just

 stopped by to say thank you. You're welcome. I bought a pregnancy

 test, but it's too soon to take it. I wasn't talking about

 the sex, though hats off, Mother, for colluding in my rape. I

 think it's great that we can still surprise each other. No, I

 was talking more about what you did for me and Bree. What

 did I do? Your little stunt made her so angry she demanded

 we go to the police. She forced my hand. - So I

 told her everything. - Everything? - Mm. - That is rather unwise.

 I faced my worst fear, the moment I felt sure would end

 my marriage, and guess what? It didn't. - She forgave you? -

 Not entirely. Not yet. But she'll come around. The good news is

 the months of dread, the fear of discovery, that's all over. So

 thank you. And goodbye. Wait! I could be carrying your child. I

 don't care if you've got the Hodge septuplets in there. I'm sticking

 with Bree. Why must he make everything so difficult? Uh, floor's done.

 I told you I wanted this floor to sparkle like your mom's.

 Now does this floor look \"Bree Hodge clean\" to you? Uh, no.

 Looks \"Andrew Van de Kamp clean.\" But your disappointment in me is

 very Bree Hodge. OK, just for that, you get to help me

 take out the trash. I know you think I'm being a hardass,

 but I'm just looking for a basic level of professionalism. Oh. Austin?

 What the hell's going on here? Just talking to the delivery guy.

 Hey, where'd he go? Are you high? Only... Totally. - Austin! -

 Dude, not smart. But I have good reason, and when you hear

 it you're not gonna make that face anymore. Julie Mayer dumped me

 and I'm very... very upset. Your face is not changing. Get your

 stuff, get the hell out of my restaurant. You're fired. Go on.

 The floor's looking pretty clean right now, isn't it? You said he'd

 come back to me. You said deep down he still loves me.

 You heard him today, he hates me. You ravished him against his

 will. He's bound to be touchy in the short run. I'll handle

 Orson, you just worry about the baby. He said he doesn't care.

 He says that now, but he will not abandon his own flesh

 and blood. You're his flesh and blood. He put you in a

 home. You know, I usually don't say this to expectant mothers, but

 for God's sake have a Scotch. I should just call the police.

 - What? - I know what he did. If he's never gonna

 love me, why should I protect him? I'd rather see him in

 jail than playing house with Tammy Tight-ass. Knock it off, Alma. I

 will make Orson come around. I don't believe you anymore. She's got

 her claws in him and she's not letting go. Don't be so

 sure. I was looking over at their house last night, and I

 saw something very... curious. What? You can't see it down here. We

 need to be up higher. How can you see anything from here?

 There's not even a window. Gloria? Gloria! - [knocking on door] -

 Just calm down, sweetheart. - [AIma] Gloria, let me out! - Stress

 isn't good for the baby. What are you doing? Hey! Gloria! -

 [organ music plays] - [indistinct chatter] - So how are you holding

 up? - Better, now that you're here. Oh! No, I want to,

 um, keep a low profile. I've kissed a hundred lips today. I

 assure you, it would look more conspicuous if I didn't. OK, that's

 enough. Ian. Oh! You must be shattered. - I know I am.

 - Thanks for coming, Lynn. Mm! [laughs] You know, Jane used to

 kid me about you. - Did she? - She'd say, \"Lynn, if

 anything ever happens to me, I want you to marry Ian. You're

 pushy. Maybe you could get him to pick up his socks.\" Listen,

 um, if you ever need to talk, I'm here. Why don't you

 stop over some night for a home-cooked meal? Oh, that's very kind

 of you, but I wouldn't dream of putting you out. Well, I

 won't take no for an answer. Have you got my number? I

 sure as hell do. Well, I'm sure I'll find it in Jane's

 phone book. Let me give it to you, just in case. Call

 any time. Oops! Watch yourself. So I was there on a plumbing

 job. It makes complete sense. I had no reason to want her

 dead. I always thought hypnotherapy was a bunch of bull, but damn.

 This is huge, man. You didn't kill anyone. The murderer has to

 be this yellow gloves guy. Yeah, but no matter how much I

 concentrate, I still can't see a face. Ah, you will. Look at

 the progress that you've made so far. You're gonna find this guy,

 and then you're gonna hand his ass over to the cops. Yeah.

 Something like that. Hey, guys. Well, Ian seems to be holding up.

 It's just a mask. The man is devastated. Tomorrow night, I'm gonna

 swing by his place to offer him a casserole and a shoulder

 to cry on. Will that shoulder be wearing a spaghetti strap and

 Chanel No. 5? You know me so well. Oh! Look at him.

 Even in mourning the man is scrumptious. I'm sorry for eavesdropping, but

 don't you think your conversation is a little inappropriate? I mean, we're

 here to grieve, not cruise. I'm sorry, and you are...? Susan Mayer.

 I'm... a friend of the family. Then you know how lonely Ian's

 been. And if I want to do something about that, it's no

 business of yours. Look, just to save you the embarrassment, Ian's seeing

 someone. Who? I'm not at liberty to say. Under the circumstances, they'd

 prefer to keep it quiet. I don't believe it. If there were

 some bimbo in the picture, I'd have heard about it. As far

 as I'm concerned, he's free meat. OK, it's me. - What? -

 I'm the bimbo. He's my meat. All righty. I just wanted to

 clear that up. And now I'm going to go find myself a

 seat with a better view. Here are your W-4s. Please sign them

 and get them back to me as soon as possible. Also, I'm

 gonna need a copy... Hi. ...of your driver's license. - Austin? -

 Yeah. What are you doing here? I fired you. Well, Mr. Scavo

 gave me my job back. Hey! You hired him back? Did he

 tell you he was stoned on the job? Yeah, and he knows

 if he does it again he is out of here. Look, I

 don't know what kind of hustle you pulled on him. It won't

 work on me. - Lynette. - No. I fired him. And you

 are gonna stay fired. Honey, can I see you in the back

 for a sec? What the hell are you doing, talking to me

 like that in front of my staff? Sorry, but you blindsided me

 out there. No, I was the one blindsided. You just went off

 on me without hearing what my reasons were. Let's hear them. What

 are your reasons for bringing back Joe Bong-Hit? If you drop that

 tone and stop making that face. What is...? This was a business

 decision. In case you hadn't noticed, and I hadn't until the waitresses

 pointed it out, Austin is hot. He'll bring in every girl from

 Fairview High and half the boys' chorus. What's more, Edie is gonna

 include our menu in the welcome packet she gives to new homeowners.

 I'm not sure she'd feel so generous if we fired her nephew.

 - Those reasons working for you? - Yeah. I just wish you'd

 told me before you rehired him. I mean, I am the manager.

 Right. But I'm the boss. Well, kinda. No, no, not \"kind of.\"

 Really. I'm the boss. You're pulling rank on me? Look, at home,

 you get to be in charge. You decide how we discipline the

 boys, what car we buy... Everything. I consult you. Sure! And if

 you disagree, you ignore me. Look, when I go home, basically, I

 check my balls at the door. And that's fine. It works. But

 for this to work, when you walk through that door, you gotta

 check yours. OK. Really? Really. This place is your dream, so... consider

 them checked. Thanks. Now I need you to do just one more

 thing. Whatever you say, boss. I don't care if you think you

 know what's best. You don't, I do, because I'm the boss, -

 and what I say goes. - [whispers] That's it. Give it to

 me. So when I make a decision it stays made, you got

 that, Lynette? - Yes, sir. [whispers] Enough. - [whispers] Just one more.

 And if I want your opinion, I'll ask for it! But I

 probably won't, because I'm the boss. Are we clear? [whispers] Stop or

 I will hurt you. OK, I made my point. Anybody needs me,

 I'll be in the back, drinking a beer. Mm. This is delicious.

 Don't get too full. You have to leave room for dessert. Oh?

 What are we having? Well, let's just say it's going to be

 served upstairs and involves whipped cream. Is it pudding? No. Oh. You're

 flirting. Do it again, I swear I'll get it. [laughs] That's OK.

 Do you want some coffee? You bet I want coffee. Nice and

 hot and... Just finish your soup and we'll get naked. [knocking on

 door] Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Solis. I work with Luke. Is

 he available? Charles? What are you doing here? You forgot to initial

 some pages on the Halverson contract. - Can't this wait? - Market's

 already open in Tokyo. Go ahead. I'm gonna open some more wine.

 Mr. Young wants to make sure you understand that last part. Do

 you? Yeah. I get it. So when we think of Jane, let

 us remember her kind heart and her loving spirit. And now, if

 there's someone who'd like to share a special memory of our dear

 friend... I would. Hi, I'm Lynn Dean. Jane and I were sorority

 sisters. If she were here, she'd make me sing our pledge song,

 but I think there's already been enough grief for one day. [laughter]

 Now, I know how badly we've all felt for Ian during his

 long, lonely vigil. So I'm sure you'll be as happy as I

 was to learn his vigil wasn't quite so lonely after all. Oh,

 dear God. No, he found a warm, caring woman to share his

 burden... ...and so much else. Some people might find the fact that

 she's here today inappropriate, but I think she's a hero. She dared

 to brave the scorn of those who might find her actions questionable

 or even unsavory. [laughing] Oh, I was gonna ask her to stand,

 but I see she already has. Susan Mayer, say hello. Hey. Wow.

 Guess someone's in a hurry to get on with the evening. Yeah.

 [laughs] Well, I should go. - What? - I have a lot

 more work to do on that Halverson deal. - Sorry. - But

 can't it wait till after dessert? And by dessert I mean sex.

 - You are clear on that, right? - Painfully. My job's at

 stake here. I really don't have much of a choice. I think

 you've got lots of choices. Here's one of 'em. [phone rings] -

 Hello? - What do you think you're doing? - What? - I

 gave you an order and I expect you to follow it. Now

 get out of there. I'm trying, sir. I'm meeting some resistance to

 the plan we've agreed on. OK, she's not letting you leave? That's

 fine. Here's what I want you to say. Uh-huh. OK, I'll give

 it a shot, sir. - Is that your office? - Yeah, they,

 uh... They really need me over there. OK. So... come back when

 you're done. I'll wait up. I can't. No, I really can't. What

 is with you? An hour ago you were really into me, and

 now you can't get out fast enough! OK. Truth? I thought I

 could do this, but I can't. I'm just not attracted to you.

 - Of course you are! - No, see... I really only date

 women in their twenties. - What? - Sorry. You're too old for

 me. [both grunting] I still got a lot of kick for an

 old broad, don't I? - [Bree gasps, screams] - [crashing] Mom? Mom!

 Mom, are you all right? Don't move her. She might have broken

 something. Yes, we need an ambulance, please, at 4354 Wisteria Lane. My

 wife's had a bad fall. Please hurry. What the hell is this?

 Mrs. Hodge was very lucky. She only suffered a slight concussion. If

 you have any more questions the doctor should be back soon. Thank

 you. Thank God, I was so worried. Yeah, I'll bet. What's that

 supposed to mean? I heard you two yesterday. All that stuff about

 you maybe going to jail. That's none of your business, but if

 you think I had anything to do with Bree falling... I'm not

 stupid. I know the cops have been all over you about that

 dead woman. And Mom said for you to fix it or she

 would. Is this accident how you fixed it? - You're upset, I

 get it... - No, no, you don't get it. There's a reason

 my mom put me out on the street. You've never met that

 guy. You've never met Bad Andrew. But hurt my mom, and you

 will. I love your mother. I'm gonna do everything I can to

 protect her. Yeah, so am I. Hi, I'm Bree Hodge's son. You

 see that guy right there? That's her husband. Do not, under any

 circumstances, let him be alone with her. - Why? - Because it's

 his fault she's in here. He's a dangerous guy. I've warned you.

 Anything happens to her, you're liable. Good night, Dad. [footsteps approaching] Oh,

 you're home. - Thought you're still out on your date. - Date's

 over. What do you want? I thought since I can't take you

 out for your birthday, I'd leave you a present. Don't worry, it's

 not expensive. Aw, Zach! So how'd your date go? - Is he

 crazy? You're not old. - Hm. You did not see the look

 on his face when I tried to kiss him. It was like

 he was sniffing expired milk. That's ridiculous. You're gorgeous. And you're just

 gonna get prettier every year. That's so sweet... but it's a lie.

 Every tick of the clock takes away something. Zach, what am I

 gonna do when I'm not pretty anymore? It's never gonna happen. I'm

 gonna take a little nap, OK? Just for a minute. Take as

 long as you'd like. Susan, I've looked everywhere for you. I didn't

 think to start with the, um... ...embalming room. Yeah, I'll be having

 night terrors from now on... ...which I deserve. Look, no one is

 judging you. If anything, they're judging that dreadful Lynn. I should be

 thanking you for driving her away. Usually takes a crucifix and some

 garlic. I'm so sorry I ruined Jane's funeral. - No, you didn't.

 - Yes, I did. - It's just... - What? I thought after

 we got through this really painful day, things would start to get

 better. I thought I could be more a part of your world.

 Now all your friends and family are just gonna think of me

 as the crazy lady from Jane's funeral. [sobbing] Oh, God. Oh, Ian...

 OK. This is not supposed to be about me. You should be

 upstairs... ...to say goodbye. [sighs] I'm just gonna hide out here with

 the departed until everybody leaves. No. No more hiding. We've been doing

 it far too long. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You

 helped me through the most difficult part of my life. I love

 you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

 I want to marry you. Ian, are you proposing to me? Well...

 I guess, maybe, I... - I am. - Whoa! Before you say

 another word... ...take a look around. Oh. Right. I hadn't really thought

 a lot about this moment, but when I did... the table we

 were at didn't have a blood gutter. Then may I reopen the

 subject at a more opportune time and place? Yes. I accept your

 proposal to propose. Shall we? Now I want you to dig deep.

 If you feel your memory blocked, just count to three and the

 block will melt away. It is natural and easy for you to

 recall anything. Now remember Monique Poulier. Remember the night you met her...

 Miss Poulier? I've, uh... got that part for the sink. Hello? Sorry.

 Monique's upstairs taking a nap. She wasn't feeling well. Mike? Did you

 see something? I'm her boyfriend. I, uh... [clears throat] ...figured she'd want

 to wake up to a clean kitchen. Well, I'll just finish up

 with the sink and be out of your hair. Uh, why don't

 you let me take care of the sink? I mean, I'm pretty

 handy and it's getting late. Oh. I don't mind staying. No, look,

 it's OK. I got it under control. Here. This should cover what

 we owe you. Tell Miss Poulier I hope she feels better. Will

 do. Oh, hey. Don't forget your wrench. Mike, where are you going?

 Mike! Hey, Mr. Delfino. I need to, uh, talk to your stepdad.

 Orson's not here. He went to the hospital with my mom. She's

 fine. Thanks for asking. Mr. Hodge... Your wife's just sleeping. I suggest

 you go home and do the same. I will. You OK? Yeah,

 yeah, I'm fine. It's... There was a time when we were all

 so happy. I just can't seem to remember it anymore. [Mary Alice]

 Recapturing the past is a tricky business. While most memories are simply

 souvenirs of a happier time... Hey there. [Mary Alice]... others can be

 quite deadly. Hey, Mike. What brings you to the hospital? I've been

 seeing a hypnotherapist. She's helping me fill the gaps in my memory.
