 ":"Previously

 on... Carlos' niece arrived. We want you to be part of this

 family, But you will obey our rules. Lynette and Tom got big

 news. We're gonna have another baby. Twins. You would actually send your

 wife to prison? My wife--No. My ex-Wife--You bet. Orson resorted to blackmail.

 I think you're the most fascinating woman That I have ever met.

 And karl made his move. Katherine's marriage to mike... That woman I

 was with-- Tell her I had to go. It's an emergency. Was

 put on hold. You guys are in danger. Get out of that

 car. Get away from dave. And when the dust settled, wedding bells

 rang For someone. The veil was made from the finest silk. The

 garter was trimmed with handmade lace. The shoes were designed by the

 top couturier in milan. You see, The bride wanted only the best

 for her wedding day Because she was about to marry the best

 man in the world... For the second time. How do you feel?

 Like the worst person in the world. Don't do this to yourself.

 Katherine is never gonna forgive me for this. Mom, this is your

 day. You and mike were meant to be together. Wish me luck.

 Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you Husband

 and wife. You may kiss the bride. Yes, the bride wanted The

 best wedding money could buy. But as she left the altar, it

 suddenly occurred to her... Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? She

 should've spent more on security. It's not hard to find sin in

 the suburbs. Just look behind closed doors. That's where you'll find your

 neighbors Cheating on their taxes... And drinking too much vodka... And stealing

 their father's magazines. Yes, the suburbs are filled with sinners, Some of

 who occasionally... repent. We can't do this. It's adultery. Luckily, we're both

 adults. Mmm. Stop! I'm married. Yes,o a man who's blackmailing you. Don't

 you think making love to your divorce lawyer Would be a nifty

 way to get back at him? Mmm. Oh, karl. No. No! No.

 What now? If I'm gonna break a commandment, I don't want it

 to be for a quickie on this couch. Who said quickie? I've

 got 40 minutes before my 10:00. And thou shalt get sweaty. I

 wanna do this. I do. But not here. I need to feel

 special. But you are special. Are you saying You've never made love

 to another woman on this couch? Not a special woman. Okay. All

 right. I get it. I get it. I want this to be

 nice for you. I'll find us a hotel. Call me later when

 you've set something up. Done. Ahem. And just so we're clear, this

 visit was not billable. Morning. I'm late for school. I don't have

 time for breakfast. At least take a muffin. Thank you, uncle Carlos.

 Kind of warm for a sweatshirt, isn't it? Oh, it gets really

 cold in the classroom. Mm. Stop. Lift it up. Gaby. Girls who

 spend an hour on makeup Do not wear baggy sweatshirts. Lift it.

 Well, that oughta heat up the classroom. Go and change. Gaby, what

 is your problem? All the girls in my class dress like this.

 That's why your school nurse is an obstetrician. Wear something else. Fine.

 I'll borrow one of your tops. It might be exciting For it

 to go someplace besides the supermarket. Oh, snap! Hey, you I can

 hit. Do you see what I have to put up with? It

 was just a shirt. Yeah? And when she came home past curfew,

 it was just 40 minutes. And when she took money from my

 purse, it was just $5. Why do you always make excuses for

 her? She's had a sad life. Her mom's in jail. Her dad

 walked out. Yeah, yeah, she's one dead dog away from a country

 song. I don't care. Well... Maybe she would calm down If she

 felt a little more secure here. I'm not signing those papers. We

 need to be her legal guardians. And look after her for the

 next two years? No. Until I see a change in her behavior,

 I'm keeping all my options open. Is this better? Yes. Very nice.

 Thank you. Stop. Mmm. What do I smell? Despair. Mortality. Paralyzing fear.

 Oh. I thought it was waffles. Do you realize that when these

 twins finish high school, I'll be in my 60s? No. No, you'll

 be in your, uh... Huh. At their graduation, I will be the

 crazy old lady with oatmeal on her chin. Look, I know this

 wasn't planned, But we--We can do this. I mean, we had a

 lot of fun raising the first four kids. But we were done,

 Tom. We were across the finish line. No more diapers. No more

 strained carrots. No more reading stupid \"goodnight, moon\"! Lynette-- And with preston

 going to europe, We even had one moving out! We will never

 be done If we birth two every time one moves out! That's

 just math! Eight and half months to go. Yay. Are you all

 right? You know what's funny? I was never able to picture us

 old together, Sitting on the porch, gray hair. I tried, But I

 could never see it. I'm sorry. Oh, Katherine, you don't have to--

 Mike, please. I don't need another reminder of you. So... how'd it

 go? How was she? She was... okay. \"Okay\"? What does that mean?

 I mean, did you tell her everything? Did you tell her we're

 getting married? Yeah. I think she's trying to take the high road.

 The high road? Um, as in, \"I wish you and Susan the

 best\"? Or the high road as in, \"when I cut Susan's brake

 line, She'll careen off the high road\"? Well, she knows it's over,

 and she's dealing with it. Mm, that must have been really hard

 for you. Yeah, it was. Mm. But now that she knows, it'll

 be easier when you talk to her. Me talk to her? Uh,

 why? Why? Why? I--You're the one who was dating her, I'm--I just...

 I don't... I think we're good now. Honey, you're gonna have to

 deal with her at some point. Fine. Yes, I will. I will.

 Um, just, uh, not today, 'cause today julie's coming home And, uh...

 you know, I wanna get her settled in. So... what about tomorrow?

 Ooh, that's not good either, 'Cause julie and I are gonna pick

 out my wedding dress. You live right across the street from her.

 You can't avoid her for the next 50 years. Well, not 50.

 Just till she's too old to throw things. Don't worry about it.

 I think Katherine's really gonna surprise you. All of the windows are

 triple pane energy efficient. Oh, and I should mention the hardwood floors

 were Completely redone recently. Black walnut. It's nice. So do you have

 any questions for me? Nah, I think you pretty much got it

 covered. Really? Check me out! I'm--I'm new at this. I just got

 my broker's license last week. Congratulations. It's a pretty nice house for

 your first listing. I got really lucky. The woman who handled The

 properties in the neighborhood-- She slammed her car into a pole and

 got fried by a power line. Like I said, congrats. Uh, mrs.

 Bolen's been awfully quiet. So what do you think? Me? I'm thinkin'

 you're full of crap. I'm sorry? Well, the fact that we can

 afford this place Says to something is wrong with it. So, uh,

 start talkin'. Mold? Termites? Leaky roof? Honestly, I have told you everything

 that I know. Sure, you could play it like that. But if

 we do buy this place and it turns into a money pit,

 I'm gonna need to take my anger out on someone. Like maybe

 the realtor who made a big deal Out of telling us he

 lives right across the street? Okay, well, I don't know That this

 is actually considered a flaw, But a while ago, uh, the lady

 who was living here-- She was apparently going through kind of a

 tough time, And long story short, she committed suicide. Shot herself... In--In

 the head. In this room. That's it? Well, yeah. We'll take it.

 Really? Oh, that is so... that is-- Okay, I'll just--I'll just get

 the paperwork. It's a nice place. I think we could be happy

 here. Right, danny? Why are you asking me? I didn't want to

 move here. Oh, honey. Whose fault was that? Julie! Look at you!

 Oh, angie, these are incredible. What do you call 'em again? Pizzelles.

 Come on, eat up. I made six dozen. My grandmother's recipes were

 always for 30 people. Trust me, she'd fatten you four up in

 a week. These go straight to your ass. Hmm. Okay. I'm sorry.

 Do you guys not say \"ass\"? Sure, we do. Come on, Bree.

 Show her. So, uh, Susan tells me That your son is about

 to start college. Mm-Hmm. We're just dealing with some paperwork, But he

 should be startin' sometime next week. Oh, I thought he was already

 in class. Uh, he asked julie to tutor him in math. Really?

 Oh, that must be Katherine. I'll get it. Katherine? Y-You didn't say

 Katherine was coming. She's just dropping something off. What's the matter? You've

 seen her since this mike thing. (Voice raises) oh, yeah... sorta. Your

 voice just got very high. You have talked to her, haven't you?

 I'm...going to. I've just been so busy with all the wedding plans.

 Yeah, I wouldn't open with that. Hi. I'm just dropping off the

 menu For the davenport anniversary party. You finished that? Already? It's three

 months away. Well, I have a lot of free time on my

 hands these days. Hello, Susan. Oh! Hi, Katherine. How--How are you doing?

 Haven't seen you in a while. Well, I've been... Using the back

 door a lot more lately. Katherine, your buttons... Oh! I don't know

 where my head is anymore. Whoa. Was it just me or was

 that the most awkward moment ever? You bet your sweet ass it

 was. Hon, could you get me a glass of water, please? You

 got it. Thanks. It's our first. Yeah, I got that. How about

 you? Four at home, two on the way. Oh, big family. You're

 so blessed. I just can't imagine anything better than being a mommy.

 Really? I mean, I know it's a lot of work, But luckily

 my husband plans to be really hands-On. Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

 Pardon? Oh, he'll be there at first, Maybe even change a diaper

 or two Until the novelty wears off. But those 4:00 a.M. Feedin

 He said he'd help out with? Forget it. Oh, you don't know

 my Johnny. He's different. Does he have boobs? No. Then you're the

 only bar in town. That baby can scream into a bullhorn, And

 Johnny won budge. O-Okay. Thanks. I'm not done. You see this? You'll

 never wear a bikini again. But you've had four kids, and you

 look good. You haven't seen me naked. Yoan stomach looks like spanish

 stucco. And my breasts resemble Two balloons you'd find behind the couch

 A week after the party. You know, most women say This is

 the greatest experience of their life. Most women are liars. My mother

 was liar, and her mother was a liar, And your mother is

 a liar. It's a lie every generation tells the next So they

 can get grandchildren. Please stop talking to me. No, you need to

 hear this. You have to be prepared. Your children will hit you

 and steal from your purse. Your husband will begin to buy your

 birthday presents At the car wash. And the kicker-- For the rest

 of your life, There will be so many moments when you feel

 lonely, But you will never be alone. They were out of water.

 Is juice okay? Hormones. Get used to it. I cannot believe we

 are finally going to do this. You're not an easy woman to

 pin down, But I sure am going to enjoy trying. What? This

 is not what I was expecting. Hey, I think I look pretty

 good for my age. Not you, karl. The room. It's filthy and

 hideous. Well, I took you to a nice hotel last week, And

 we had to leave 'cause you saw someone you knew. Who we

 gonna run into here? Well, certainly not a cleaning lady. Okay, so

 it's a little dusty. But trust me, Once I get started, you'll

 never even notice. My god, those sheets! What's wrong with them? They're

 discolored, threadbare and reek of industrial bleach. You give me five minutes,

 they'll reek of us. Karl, I'm not gonna lie on that revolting

 sheet, Wondering how many junkies have died on it. What do you

 want me to do about it? Ooh, egyptian cotton! These are pretty,

 aren't they? Great. Love 'em. Let's go. It doesn't help when you

 say that about every single set. Bree, an hour ago, I was

 half-Naked. Now I'm sheet shopping. Forgive me if I'm an easy sell.

 I'm just not sure this color will match the carpet. Well, get

 'em in blue. I'll tell you what they'll match then. Fine. I'll

 take these. Now we just need to stop for some flowers. Flowers?

 I just want this affair to be nice. You know, you don't

 want this affair to be nice. You don't want it at all.

 Don't be silly. Of course I do. You may think you do,

 But I've been chasing you for two weeks, And you've down nothing

 but throw up roadblocks. \"Not tonight.\" \"Not this hotel.\" \"Not those sheets.\"

 Karl, if you think I've been leading you on, you're wrong. Bree,

 it's not your fault. It's just who you are. You're a good

 girl who never breaks the rules No matter how miserable it makes

 her. I thought a little karl time might brighten your day. But

 there's not much I can do for someone Who would rather be

 good than happy. Can I help you? I've got a delivery for

 Susan mayer, But she's not home. Do you mind signing for her?

 Oh. That must be her gown. Of course I'll take it. We

 do things like this for each other all the time. In fact,

 just last month, She took in something of mine. Oh, god. Oh,

 god. Oh, god. Oh, god. Um, Katherine, it's me. I-I've just come

 over to pick up my... Hello, Susan. Okay, I did not see

 that coming. It's just so beautiful. I couldn't resist. Well... Thank you

 for taking such good care of it. But I should probably go

 now, So if you just wanna slip it off and... Oh, wait.

 I have to check on my sauce. Sauce? Mmm! Doesn't that smell

 good? It smells done. Why don't you step away from the pot?

 Oh, no. The secret is you have to keep stirring. You know,

 I really love this fabric. It feels so expensive. It is. That's

 why they had it all protected With that acid-Free tissue paper and

 plastic garment bag. Huh. Maybe... I should give you some of this

 sauce to take to mike. He used to love my sauce. Of

 course, He used to love me, too. Okay, enough with the sauce.

 I want my dress back now. Of course. I'm sorry. Can you

 please unzip me? Mm. It really is a beautiful dress. Katherine was

 actually wearing the dress? Yes! Stop blocking my light. Keep blotting. Ugh!

 Mom, relax. We got all the sauce. No, I still see flecks

 of red. It's your third wedding. An all-White dress is gonna be

 a stretch anyway. Do me a favor. Save the \"my mom's a

 slut\" jokes for the toast. You think I should go talk to

 her again? What? Why? Well, she's obviously hurting more than I thought.

 Excuse me, she kidnapped my wedding dress And held a pot of

 sauce to its head! How could you possibly defend her? I'm not

 defending her. I'm just a little concerned. Aren't you? No! I mean...

 (sighs) yes, I was. But at this point, I'm a little sick

 of her. Do you know that when I told people that I'm

 getting married, No one says congratulations. They all say, \"oh, my god.

 Is Katherine okay? How's Katherine?\" Does no one remember that you were

 with me first? She stole my leftovers. Does nobody remember that? Did

 she just refer to me as leftovers? My point is that I

 didn't do anything wrong. You and I have a child, And I

 am just tired of feeling like the other woman. Scary part is,

 of the two women you could marry, That's the stable one. Thanks

 for taking me to the store. I promised Roy I'd make him

 meatloaf. Oh, I think it's sweet That you found a male companion

 at this stage in your life. Roy's no companion. The man has

 seen Paris. That's right. I'm back in the saddle. It started one

 night when Roy asked If my bathtub was big enough for two--

 Hey! You want me to crash the car? 'Cause I will. Hey,

 aunt Gaby. Need your car washed? Oh! I'm aunt Gaby now? Let

 me guess. You want something. Well, there is a party tomorrow night...

 Really?! Okay, you can go. Seriously? Well, if you can make an

 effort around here, Then I guess I can, too. Just be home

 by 10:00. Yeah, that's the thing. The party doesn't start till 11:00.

 What kind of party starts at 11:00? This new dance club is

 opening downtown, And it is, like, the hottest thing ever. Everybody's going.

 Not everybody. It's a school night, and you know the rules. But

 thank you for washing the car. Well, she's quite the charmer. Do

 you see what I'm dealing with? I mean, Carlos and I basically

 took her off the street. You'd think she'd be grateful. But every

 day is a battle. I don't know how to get through to

 her. Teenage girls--They're the best reason for not having kids. Thank god

 Roy had a vasectomy. So based on the data given for this

 population, And using the standard deviation formula, What do you think this

 variable is? Would you like to go to a movie sometime? It's

 not like it would be a date or anything. We're friends, right?

 Friends go to movies all the time. I don't know if you

 know that. Did you know that? I did know that. Okay. Really?

 That's great. Hey, julie. Nice to see you again. Danny, do me

 a favor and take the trash out, will ya? Uh... can I

 do it a little later? Uh, yeah. Yeah, you could, But I

 think you're gonna do it right now. Hey, thanks for doing that.

 Doing what? Not shooting him down. I know he's probably not your

 type. No, I like him. He's nice. Well, yeah, yeah, but, uh...

 Clearly not in your league. I'm sorry you have to work late,

 sweetie. Don't worry about us. Everything is fine here. Good night, Ana.

 Oh! Sorry. Ana paid me $5. # You spin me right 'round

 # # Baby, right 'round # # Like a record, baby #

 # Right 'round, 'round, 'round # # You spin me right 'round

 # Ooh! Hey, muscles. I need a lift. # Right 'round, 'round,

 'round # # You spin me right 'round # Ooh! Hey! Hands!

 Hands! Hands! # Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'rnd #

 # You spin me right 'round, baby # # Right 'round, like

 a record, baby # # Right 'round, 'round, 'round # Um, excuse

 me! Sorry to interrupt. But can I have your attention, please? Hello?

 Okay. Hi. My niece is somewhere in this building. She's got brown

 hair, gold leggings, a cream top... Which she took from my closet.

 So if you could just look around and point her out... No,

 hey, hey, this is important, okay? She's only 16. And she came

 here even though she knew she wasn't supposed to. Hey! Hey! Hey!

 Hey! Either you find my niece, Or I will call the cops

 with their drug-Sniffing dogs. Found her over here! Here she is! Stop.

 Put me down. Somebody... Get your hands off me. Let me down.

 God, what are you doing? Ugh. Thank you, everybody. Put the music

 back on. I told you not to mess with me. I cannot

 keep doing this, Ana. Or what? You're gonna throw me out? Fine.

 You'd actually be doing me a favor. I can take care of

 myself. You're 16. How exactly are you gonna make money? I'm... I'm

 gonna be a model. A model? Yeah. You know, people tell me

 that I'm pretty enough. I-I will just--I'll go to Paris or New

 York, And I'll get discovered. And I will be-I'll go rich and

 famous,york, And no one will ever tell me what to do again.

 And you really think it's that easy to become a model? It

 was for you. What, you left home when you were only 15.

 No, I left because I had to. My stepfather was... Not a

 nice man. My mother didn't care about me. My father left when

 I was 3, And my mother's been in and out of prison

 ever since. I can beat you at this game. This is not

 a game, Ana! This is your life. You can't scare me, all

 right? And I don't stay where I'm not wanted. Oh, don't give

 me that. We feed you. We put a roof over your head.

 And you're also keeping all your options open. Yeah. I heard. Oh,

 good, you're back. The girls haven't made a peep. Gaby? No more

 options. I am now officially your guardian. So... what? I'm supposed to

 hug you now? No, you're not gonna want to hug me, Because

 from here on out, I am gonna be watching you like a

 hawk. I wanna know where you are going, who you are going

 with, And when you are coming home. And I'm gonna keep you

 from ruining that life You are so anxious to start living. You

 are so mean. Yeah. And I wish... I wish... Someone had been

 this mean to me when I was your age. Danny, look, it's

 complicated. No, it's really simple, julie. You only care about yourself. Please

 let me explain! Go to hell. Katherine said you were here. And

 I thought, since you were already in church, We might see the

 pastor And schedule some counseling sessions. I don't need counseling, Orson. I

 need a divorce. Don't tell me we don't need counseling. You've been

 sleeping in the guest room for weeks. It's not right. I agree,

 and if you had An ounce of chivalry, you'd have given me

 the master. You might think that withholding sex Will make me give

 up on us. But I can be very patient. You do realize

 in prison, I went three whole years without any sex. No, but

 thank you for clearing up a question I never quite knew how

 to ask. Bree, eight years ago, We stood at an altar like

 this, And we made a vow before god to love each other.

 Do you think I haven't struggled with this? I've struggled with this

 in ways you can't even begin to imagine. Then let me help

 you. I can make you happy again. How? By blackmailing me? I'm

 not your wife anymore, Orson. I'm your captive. Don't you feel any

 remorse at all over that? Of course I do, But sometimes guilt

 Is a small price to pay for happiness. There it is. Baby

 number one. Oh, my god. It was so worth cutting class to

 hear this. And... there's number two. Good, strong heartbeats. Isn't that great,

 lynette? Yeah. Terrific. I'll... Get the nurse, have her come clean you

 up. Thank you. So what's with you? What? That was an amazing

 moment, And you just sat there like y-You didn't even care. I'm

 just tired. Look, I know this has been a shock, And I'm

 trying to give you time, but it's been three months. When are

 you gonna start getting excited about our kids? What? I don't love

 them. Lynette. Please. Don't look at me that way. If I can't

 talk to you about this, Then I am in big trouble. You're

 just upset because... this wasn't planned. None of them were planned, But

 I loved each of our kids The moment I knew they were

 coming. It's different this time. I don't love these babies. Stop saying

 that. When you hold them in your arms, You will care about

 these kids Just as much as the others. Okay. I think I

 left something in the car. I'll see you inside. Bree. Orson will

 drink too much today, Like he always does at weddings. He'll be

 asleep by 9:00. Meet me at the shangrila motel at 9:30. And

 you won't bail on me again? I booked the room last night.

 I've already changed the sheets and cleaned the bathroom. Kiss me. What

 happened to the good girl? She decided guilt's A small price to

 pay for happiness. Ahh. Frankly, I think it looked better on me.

 Katherine. What are you doing here? You may have noticed that I've

 been out of sorts lately, And I just couldn't understand why. I

 mean, sure, I was dumped by the love of my life, But

 it was more than that. (Drops bracelet) And then it hit me.

 My friend-- Who was sort of responsible for my world imploding-- Never

 bothered to cross the street To see how I was doing. Didn't

 have the... Decency to apologize. I am very, very-- No, not here.

 Out there. In the hallway? In your ceremony. Everybody in town knows

 you humiliated me. I think I deserve a public apology. In the

 middle of my wedding? I found the perfect spot, right here. After

 the reading of ecclesiastes And right before \"we've only just bun.\" I

 am not doing that. Yes, you will, Or I will create a

 scene so ugly Your guests will still be talking about it On

 your golden anniversary. Okay. But I am not happy about this. Aw.

 Try to smile anyway. Nobody likes a grumpy bride. Why don't we

 just get this over with? Would you mind getting my gloves? They're

 in the garment bag. Aah! I'm sorry. It's just until after the

 ceremony. Susan! And from this day forward, You shall be each other's

 home. You shall be each other's sanctuary. Susan, let me out! With

 this ring, I thee wed. Aah! Sorry I'm late. Did I miss

 anything? What the hell? What are you doing here? Susan knows. Look,

 I don't know what you want, But I'm asking you nicely to

 leave. And if you don't, so help me god, I will drag

 you out of this church myself. I'm sorry. I... I-I just wanted...

 I'll go. Katherine, wait. Uh... oh. Uh... hello, everybody. I just wanna

 say something. Oh, we don't need this on the video. Um... When

 mike asked me to marry him... Again, It was one of the

 happiest days of my life. But for someone else, It was the

 day her whole world fell apart. And I have to admit, I...

 I didn't care. In that moment, I was a selfish person, And

 I chose my happiness. But I want you all to know That

 I am truly sorry For changing her path. And I hope That

 Katherine mayfair finds happiness And can find it in her heart to

 forgive me... And be my friend again. I hope that helped. Honestly...

 It didn't. Where the hell is danny? He left the wedding two

 hours ago and he's not in his room. He'll be home soon.

 You know, what has gotten into that kid? He's staying out late,

 pickin' fights with girls in public. He knows better than that. He's

 a teenager. Well, go look for him. We can't afford to make

 waves here. Everyone has to think we are nice, normal people. Yeah.

 It's not hard to find sin in the suburbs. Just look behind

 closed doors, And you'll find your neighbors Cheating on their husbands.... Resenting

 their children... Plotting against their friends. But as much as we like

 to talk about The sinful things people do... We forget there is

 a difference between sin... And evil. Sadly, there's always someone willing to
