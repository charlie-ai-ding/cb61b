 Previously on Desperate Housewives: - Police dug up your father. They think

 somebody poisoned him. Apparently, I'm a suspect. Bree felt threatened by the

 past. - Get the lawyer. - You hitting on me? Gabrielle was

 threatened by seduction. Julie? If I come back, I could make it

 up to her. You should try to find your father first. Let

 me help. And while some threats... ...were kept under control... Let's get

 this over with. ...some were left free to return. ...the old-fashioned way,

 a Russian classic. Since her first day on the job, it had

 been clear to Lynette Scavo that her new boss, Nina, was unusually...

 tense. To help relieve her tension, Lynette tried giving her boss thoughtful

 gifts: A soothing wave machine... ...aromatherapy candles... ...even meditative chi balls. But

 nothing seemed to ease Nina's tension. \"Distilled the old-fashioned way.\" You know,

 it actually hurts my teeth to say that out loud. You folks

 are going to toddle back to your little holes and come up

 with a decent slogan, or I will can all your asses, the

 old-fashioned way. Until one day, when it occurred to Lynette... ...there was

 one form of relaxation she had yet to try. It's a gimlet.

 You'll love it. What exactly is your plan, to get me all

 liquored up so I'll buy the revised pitch? Don't be ridiculous. Could

 we get a trough of these, please? I can't remember the last

 time I was in a bar. Must have been the last time

 I had a boyfriend, which was... Oh, God, I'm a nun. So

 why don't you go out and get in the game? Believe it

 or not, when it comes to meeting men, I am... shy. Well,

 I'm not. So, what about that guy over there? He's been checking

 you out since we walked in. - He's cute. - So go

 over there. - No. - Oh, for God's sakes. Where are you

 going? Lynette, sit... Hey, stretch. See my friend over there? She thinks

 you're cute. Why don't you buy her a drink? Hey, everybody. Hi.

 Oh, it's a beautiful morning, isn't it? Thank you, sweetie. Oh, hey,

 Lynette, I read the new vodka proposal. - You guys hit it

 out of the park. - Wow. - I love that colour. -

 Thanks. - Hey, Nina. - Yeah. And although it had come about

 in an unexpected manner... Are those the clothes you wore last night

 in the bar? Yep. ...Nina's tension had finally been released... ...the old-fashioned

 way. Everyone in this world needs someone they can depend upon. Be

 it a faithful companion... ...trusted confidante... ...or loyal friend. For Susan Mayer,

 that dependable someone was her book agent, Lonnie Moon. It was Lonnie

 who helped Susan promote her first children's book. It was Lonnie who

 rushed Susan to the hospital the night Julie was born. It was

 Lonnie who took Susan's mind off her painful divorce with a fun

 vacation. Yes, Lonnie was Susan's rock. Sadly, for Susan, her rock was

 about to crumble. ...for their friends and for her family. For those

 of you joining us, a development in the Melanie Foster case. -

 Lonnie! What are you doing here? - It's past noon. Which means

 it's now socially acceptable to begin drinking. I can't believe I let

 you talk me into this. I am so behind in my work.

 But I'm glad I came. This is fun. I've gotta be honest.

 I had an ulterior motive. I've decided to start my own agency.

 You're leaving Muir & Hunt? You helped build that place. I know,

 but I just feel it's time. And now the question is, will

 you come with me? Well, of course. OK! To the future! I'll

 just call the agency and let them know I'm going with you.

 Oh, I don't think that's necessary. Really? Yeah, I think it might

 be rude not to. Lonnie, what's going on? OK. There's been some

 bad blood between me and the partners. Why? I got into this

 thing where I had to move a little client money around temporarily

 to cover some expenses. You had to move money? What does that

 mean? I took a little from here, and I moved it there.

 It was no big deal. Really? Because it sort of sounds like

 embezzlement. Why do people keep using that word? - Who else is

 using that word? - Nobody. The partners and their forensic accountant. Oh,

 my God. Lonnie, did you move some of my money? Absolutely not!

 I swear! Susan, don't look at me that way. I know what

 I did was wrong, and I feel like a complete idiot for

 doing it. But please, please, don't hate me. I don't hate you.

 I couldn't hate you. You're my Lonnie. So... Will you still come

 with me? You know what? This is one of those times when

 you find out who your real friends are. So... yeah. Thank you,

 thank you! You are one special lady, Susan Mayer! - Is that

 the baby's head? - No, that's his foot. That looks like a

 head to me. Well, that settles it. When this baby's born I'll

 be in charge of putting on the socks. You're glowing today, you

 know that? - Pregnancy agrees with you. - Yeah? Well, if you

 don't mind the haemorrhoids and the nausea, it's quite the party. Wonder

 where David is. He should have been here by now. - So

 this new lawyer's good? - He's quite the shark. You're gonna love

 him. He hasn't lost a case in six years, he argued in

 front of the state Supreme Court and he made our conjugal visit

 happen pretty damn fast. Well, hey, I'm a fan already. Sorry I'm

 late. Oh, David. Good to see you, Gabby. Carlos, I'm David. I

 don't think so. What the hell are you doing? That guy's not

 gonna be my lawyer. Find a new one. You haven't filed a

 single charge! Either determine a homicide or release the body. We got

 a court order which says until we're done, the corpse is ours!

 He is not a corpse! He is a man named Rex Van

 De Kamp. He was a loving husband, a devoted father and a

 successful doctor. So successful, in fact, that he left me enough money

 to sue the city, this precinct and you two gentlemen personally, just

 for the fun of it. Mrs Van De Kamp, we don't respond

 well to threats. If I were you... Release the body. What? The

 evidence we have is minimal at best. She was gracious enough to

 take that lie detector test. It's the least we can do for

 her. Thank you. So, what will happen now? Obviously, we'll put Mr

 Van De Kamp back just like we found him. Yes, and I'm

 sure you will bury him with all the dignity of a dead

 hamster. No. I want Rex released to me, and I will make

 all the arrangements. Fine. And, of course, you'll be paying all the

 costs. Of course. Detective Barton, you are clearly a gentleman. People have

 gathered at Attenborough High School, where Melanie... No, it's fine. I'll pick

 them up on my way home. OK, so, what do you want?

 Oh, Parker hates pepperoni. How about sausage? Yeah, and a small cheese.

 OK. Perfect. Love ya. - Hey, you. - Hey. You wanna hit

 O'Donnell's? I owe you a beer. Actually, I owe you so much

 more than that. You're welcome. But I need to get home. Oh,

 come on. I had such a good time last night. Ask Trudy.

 She loves going out. Trudy? Are you kidding? I don't need the

 competition. Have you seen Trudy without her jacket? She's hot. - Oh,

 is she now? - Oh, no. I didn't mean that you're not

 hot. I just... You're married. You're off the market. I don't have

 to worry about fighting you for guys. Come on, Lynette, just one

 quick little drink. I was actually starting to think that you and

 I were becoming pals. Pals? Because sometimes it's hard to tell. You

 know, I wasn't feeling the love today when you mocked my campaign

 in front of the clients. That was just putting on a show

 for work. In the future, always assume that I'm winking inside. Come

 on, I hate to go to a bar alone. I feel like

 such a loser. OK. One drink. Yeah, one or two. No. Thank

 you so much for bringing my mail over. You know, I have

 some of yours in the kitchen. That's the fourth time. What's up

 with this postman? I know. He used to be great. Then he

 had the stroke, and... Well, now we're lucky if he doesn't drool

 on the coupons. But feel free to snoop around. I'll be right

 back. Now, for those of you just joining us, families in Chicago

 breathed a sigh of relief today as an arrest was finally made

 in the brutal attack on local high school student, Melanie Foster. But

 word of the suspect's capture comes as small comfort to the Foster

 family... Betty. ...who lost their 17-year-old daughter four months ago. Betty? ...less

 than a mile from Attenborough High. Did you see the news? They've

 arrested somebody. Yeah. Looks like we're in the clear. Well, I have

 some good news. The police have finally released Rex's body. - About

 time! - You must be so relieved. I'm just annoyed the whole

 thing happened in the first place. I mean, how in the world

 could anybody accuse me of murder? Well, you are wound pretty tight.

 What? The supermom is always the first to snap. They've done studies.

 I was hoping that you were all free Friday morning because that's

 when I'm going to be hosting the re-burial. The what? I know

 it's an imposition, but Danielle is away on a class trip, and

 Andrew is back at Camp Hennessey for a little refresher course. Well,

 it's just gonna be a very brief and dignified ceremony. And I

 was hoping that you could say a few words, and I'm gonna

 read a poem. - We would love to come. - Absolutely. I'm

 busy. Sorry. - Edie. - She's going to read a poem. Fine.

 Yes, yes, we'd all love to come. Well, thank you. You don't

 know how much this means to me. I realised, looking back, that

 I was still in shock during Rex's first funeral. I don't think

 it had quite hit me yet what had happened. So that's why

 this small ceremony means so much to me, because I realise now

 that... ...this is the last chance I'm gonna have to say goodbye.

 Unless, of course, they dig him up again. Sure, there was times

 when Lisa was rude and obnoxious, but I know now that that

 was no excuse to always be beating on her. Baby, I'm just

 so sorry. Good job, you two. This is an example of how

 to use incarceration to your benefit. It's a chance for people to

 take a step back and observe the obstacles they face in their

 marriage. Can I go now? I have a lot to say about

 the obstacles I'm facing in my marriage. - We don't got any

 obstacles. - Yes, we do, Lamar. We got big ones! OK. Hold

 on, you two. I think that it's Carlos and Gabrielle's turn. Thanks,

 but we're good. This is your third group session, but you have

 yet to share anything. Come on. Talk to us. How's your marriage?

 Shaky, at best. And why is that? I don't know. I hired

 a brilliant lawyer to get my husband out of this hellhole, and

 he fired him for no reason at all. Carlos? - I just

 didn't like him. - Why not? He's experienced, intelligent, successful... I'd prefer

 an attorney you didn't find so appealing. Oh, my God! You fired

 him because you're jealous? Don't I have the right to? You know,

 she cheated on me. You beat your wife! You are not allowed

 to gasp. Don't you talk that way to him. One more word,

 and I will backhand you. - OK. Calm down. - Thousands of

 fat, bald attorneys, and she gets one that looks like an underwear

 model. I'm not discussing this anymore. You can rot in here for

 all I care! So... Mona, what do you feel are the biggest

 problems in your marriage? He was wearing a suit. How do you

 know he had a good body? - Do you know? - No!

 I bet he's hot. Do I need to say what our biggest

 problem is? Or can everybody figure it out for themselves? Why are

 you reading that contract? I told you. Lonnie wants me to sign

 with his new agency. But you didn't say you were seriously thinking

 about going with him. I know. I know. It's just, Lonnie's family.

 You know, he's always been there for me. He paid my rent

 when I was waiting for my first royalty cheque. He called me

 every day when Karl left. I mean, I just owe him so

 much. Susan, he committed a felony. OK, who in this room has

 not committed a felony, raise your hand. - Not so fast. -

 Your agent represents you. You got to be able to trust him.

 How's that gonna be possible now? Well, it's possible because I have

 faith in people. I mean, Lonnie knows he messed up, and he's

 sorry. He's making restitution. You don't believe people deserve second chances? Not

 when they messed up this much. No. Really? So that's it with

 you? You just get one shot, and you screw up, and you're

 out? I didn't know you were such a cynic. I'm sorry, all

 right? I guess it's just the way I'm wired. But I got

 a job over in Greenwood, so I'll call you later tonight. You

 OK? Julie. I did something bad. Something really, really bad. Aren't you

 gonna ask me what it was? Do I ever have to? Last

 week when Mike and I went to the park, searching for Zach...

 ...I sort of found him. - No! - Yes! And I gave

 him money, and I sent him away. And I didn't tell Mike.

 - Holy crap. What are you gonna do? - I don't know.

 What would you do if this happened to you? This would never

 happen to me. This kind of thing only happens to you. Will

 you stop judging and help me? Obviously, you have to tell him.

 I can't do that. You heard what he said about his wiring.

 I betrayed him. - He'll never forgive me. - OK. Don't tell

 him. Well, how can I not? I feel so guilty, I can

 barely look him in the eye when he talks about Zach. So,

 where do you think Zach went? Utah. Oh, Lord. Why did I

 do this? I have a feeling you did it for me. Hey,

 girl. I hope you are in the mood for margaritas because it

 is salsa night at O'Donnell's. Oh, fun. But I can't go tonight,

 because I promised the twins I would help them finish their science

 project. Lynette, if the late hours are going to be an issue

 for you, we probably should talk about finding you a less demanding

 account. You're gonna take me off Kamarov because I won't go drinking

 with you? No. Oh... God, no. Honey, I get it. You have

 a family. Home has to come first for you. Thank you. I

 mean, for me, the client comes first. Being a perfectionist is my

 own neurotic issue, and I need to work on that. But trust

 me, I will never sleep again if this campaign gets mucked up.

 I'll figure something out. You go home, have a good night. Nina.

 Yeah? I can handle the extra hours. Oh, Lynette. You sure? -

 Yeah. - I'll get my coat. Wow, this place is rowdy after

 happy hour, huh? - Yeah. - Hey. Look at that guy, right

 there, the end of the bar? The shoulders with the tan jacket?

 - Yeah? - Go get him for me. Hey, there. So they're

 going on about Melanie Foster on the news. It's time we talked

 about her, Caleb. Until you start accepting responsibility for what happened, you

 know I can't let you out of here. What the hell is

 this? Mom! Where are you? I'll be right back. And I will

 expect you to answer me. Where are you? I'm coming! Coming! -

 What were you gonna do with this? - Don't. \"I know who

 killed Melanie Foster. You arrested the wrong man.\" What are you thinking?

 - The police need to know the truth. - The hell they

 do! This is our chance! We are good people. We can't let

 an innocent man go to jail. Wanna do the right thing? Call

 911 and tell them - you got a killer in the basement.

 - He is not a killer. He was confused. He didn't know

 what he was doing. He knows a lot more than you give

 him credit for. I'm mailing the letter. Do you realise what's gonna

 happen? Mom, are you thinking this through? I'm mailing the letter. If

 you do, you better hope to God they don't find us. Cos

 they're not gonna care how slow Caleb is. They'll just execute him.

 Lonnie! Are you here? It's Susan. Lonnie? Susan? What are you doing

 here? Well, I just came over to give you the contracts. Your

 door was open. Great. Sorry this place is such a mess. I've

 been working here till we get the new offices painted. Wait till

 you see them. They're gonna be really beautiful. Where is Jeannie? She's

 with the kids up in Minnesota, visiting her mom. They love it

 up there. Keep changing the date on dear old Dad. - There's

 no electricity. - There isn't? Oh, I'm such a dummy. I've been...

 I've been so swamped. I must have forgotten to pay the electric

 bill. Lonnie... ...how much financial trouble are you really in? I'm fine.

 You know what it is? I had to pay all those people

 back at the same time, restitution plus interest. It's not something I'd

 recommend. It sucks you dry. I'm gonna ask you a question, and

 I want you to tell me the truth. Did you steal from

 me? Absolutely not. Please, don't lie. Just tell me. Is that what

 you want to hear? Do I have to say it so that

 we can move on? Fine. I did it. But yours was the

 first money I paid back, so the slate's been wiped clean. Let's

 just move past it. Suze... I'm sorry. I just can't trust you

 anymore. - Yes, you can! - No, I can't. - You can.

 - Can't. - Give me the contract! - No! OK. OK, fine.

 What are you doing? Are you trying to take me down with

 you? I am not going down! My life is great! I have

 never been happier, and I've never been thinner! Get off me, you

 Amazon! - What are you doing here? - You left me a

 message. You said you wanted to talk. Yeah. I thought you'd schedule

 an appointment later. Right now I'm sort of disgusting and sweaty. I'm

 a criminal lawyer. I've seen worse. So, did you find a new

 lawyer for Mr Charming? I don't want a new lawyer. I want

 you. So does Carlos. He just doesn't realise it yet. A 1988

 Roman?e Conti La T?che. I'm impressed. Look, to be honest, Carlos is

 a little threatened by you. He thinks if we spend too much

 time together, that something... ...might happen. Somebody's got an active imagination. Corkscrew?

 David, we're not here to drink wine. OK? This is business. Now,

 you have to convince Carlos that he can trust you. How am

 I gonna do that? I don't know. Tell him you're happily married

 or gay. Yeah, right. You're a lawyer. You lie to juries all

 the time. Make something up. I'm past the point in my career

 where I have to beg for work. OK, David, I'm holding my

 marriage together by my fingernails. If Carlos serves his full sentence, we

 won't make it. So please, I need you. I'll say this much

 for Carlos. He's got excellent taste... ...in wine. Montrachet. It's good stuff.

 Are you gonna help me or not? We'll go see Carlos tomorrow.

 I'll turn him around for you. Really? What are you gonna say?

 I'll play it by ear. I don't want to sound too over-rehearsed.

 Hey, that's my wine. Deduct it from my bill. It all started

 with bad real estate investments. You should have just come clean. Yeah,

 well, you tell one lie, the second one comes easy. Then you're

 making up new lies to cover up the old ones. Pretty soon

 you can't turn back, you know? I do. When Jeannie finally caught

 on, she took the kids, she took the furniture. The bank locked

 me out of my own house. Wow. That's why I can't lose

 you as a client. Well, I'm sorry, but you have. I don't

 blame you. You'll never lose my friendship, though. I mean that. -

 Really? - Of course. You're my Lonnie. And you're my Susie. You're

 my Susie. What the hell is wrong with you? - I'm your

 Lonnie! That's what you said! - Not like that! I thought... I

 mean, there's always been this magnetism... No. There has not been, and

 there never will be. Oh, my God! But I was just coming

 clean! Hey, Morgan! Got a letter from some guy claiming he attacked

 Melanie Foster. You ran me down for that? I got dozens of

 kooks coming out of the woodwork, saying we arrested the wrong guy.

 This one knows about the axe. Here you go, Mrs Van De

 Kamp. Thank you. The hearse is right outside, so if you'll just

 follow me... Shoot. There's a form I need you to sign. I

 think I left it in the office. - That's all right, I'll

 wait. - OK. I'm here, sweetheart. And I'm gonna take care of

 everything. But you knew that, didn't you? You've always known that you

 can count on me. Mrs Van De Kamp. Detective Barton. What are

 you doing here? Oh, just taking care of some business. - Is

 this? - Yes. This is Rex. I want to thank you again

 for what you did. It was so refreshing to be treated with

 kindness after weeks of just ludicrous accusations. The doctor doesn't think they're

 ludicrous. I know, but Rex died in his care. Of course he'd

 like to blame someone else. But the tests he did... Oh, please

 don't talk to me about tests. Rex was not poisoned. And no

 one I know believes that he was. Rex did. What? Well, the

 doctor told Rex he was being poisoned and Rex believed him. How

 would you know that? Where did you get this? We found that

 in Rex's bed after he died. That is his handwriting, isn't it?

 You know what I think? Rex felt guilty for the way he'd

 treated you. The adultery, the public humiliations. That's why he forgave you.

 He understood why you did it. How could he have believed this?

 Look, my wife cheated on me too. I know how much it

 hurts. And so will a judge. Everyone understands crimes of passion. But

 every day that you stonewall makes you look more and more like

 a cold, calculating killer. We both know that's not you. But I

 can't help you unless you start telling the truth. I'm sorry, but

 I... I have to go. I have some things that I need

 to take care of. It is obvious your husband loved you very

 much. Don't you think you owe it to him to admit the

 truth? I know exactly what my husband deserves. Now, would you be

 a dear? Thank you. What's he doing here? I have a pitch

 for you. I want to explain why it's in your best interest

 for you to allow me to represent you. Oh, for Pete's sake,

 Carlos. At least listen to the man. I guess it beats sitting

 in my cell. I don't think you have a problem with me

 as a lawyer. Clearly, I'm the real deal. I sense your problem

 with me is more personal. You sense right. You want to know

 if I'm interested in sleeping with your wife. Well, the answer is

 yes. Carlos, he's kidding. - Tell him you're kidding. - Shut it.

 Now clearly, Gabrielle is wilful, self-centred and manipulative. But she's also beautiful

 enough to be worth the trouble. The minute we leave this room,

 I'll aggressively pursue her. When I succeed, which I will, we'll fly

 to my chateau in Chamonix and have dinner at a local bistro.

 They make the best raclette in Europe. We'll make love by the

 fire and do a little midnight skiing. You ski, don't you? You're

 athletic. You'll learn. Anyway, all of this only happens if you fire

 me. Keep me on as your lawyer, your wife's off-limits. I'd get

 disbarred for sleeping with a client's wife. Nobody's worth that, not even

 her. So that's my pitch. I'll let you think about it. Honey,

 I am so sorry. Obviously, that guy's insane. Well, you just can't

 wait, can you? What? He's my lawyer. - Carlos... - That's all

 there is to it. - How about a dance? - How about

 it? Yes. Well, you guys have fun. This is the fifth night

 in a row I haven't been home to tuck in my kids.

 - So I'm gonna go. - No, you're gonna stay put. It

 is Friday night, and you have all weekend to play with your

 kids. Watch my purse. Hey, I'm Chuck. Chuck, I'm gonna stop you

 right there. Happily married. Well, looks like we have got something in

 common. Chuck, get your hand off my thigh. No, not up my

 thigh. Off it. What's the matter with you? I'm not available. And

 I'm not that easy! What are you doing in a pickup bar

 at 10.30? Well, I don't usually do this. Oh, come on, honey,

 who are you kidding? I've seen you here every night this week.

 You're a regular. At that moment, it occurred to Lynette that Chuck,

 though inebriated, had a valid point. The time had come to declare

 a war of independence. And the surest path to victory would require

 an aggressive campaign of shock and awe. It's crazy here tonight. Don't

 you wanna dance? No, thanks, I think I'll sit this one out.

 Lynette savoured her victory, confident that she would never again have to

 engage her opponent on this particular battlefield. I love this song. Here,

 hold my purse. Bree, where have you been? We were getting worried.

 I'm sorry. I was just attending to some last-minute details. Right this

 way. - Where are we going? - To Rex's gravesite. - I

 thought this was his gravesite. - I'm changing it. - Why? -

 He did something to upset me, - and I want him gone.

 - What did he do? It's so unpleasant. I'd rather not get

 into it. Have you seen these gravestones? Some are from the 1800s.

 Just fascinating. Bree, wait. You're gonna have to explain. Rex is dead.

 What could he have done to upset you? My husband, the man

 I spent my life with for 18 years, died thinking that I

 murdered him. - What? - Yes. The cardiologist shared this moronic theory

 with Rex, and Rex believed him. Are you sure? Yes, because he

 left a note, and it said, and I quote, \"Bree, I understand,

 and I forgive you.\" I spent 18 years of my life with

 this man. How could he not know me? Well, maybe he was

 forgiving you for something else. I have done nothing to be forgiven

 for! I was a fantastic wife! When he was sick, I nursed

 him. When we were low on money, I stayed within a budget.

 I cooked his meals. I mended his clothes. For the love of

 God, I used to check his back for acne! And that miserable

 son of a bitch has the nerve to understand and forgive me?

 Well, the joke's on him because I do not understand, and I

 do not forgive! Hi. We're... We're just going to a funeral. Right

 this way. I know you're hurt, but are you sure you're not

 gonna change your mind? There's no turning back after this. You think

 I'm gonna lay next to someone who thinks I'm a murderer, you're

 crazy. As far as I'm concerned, let him decompose with strangers. Everyone

 in the world needs someone they can depend on. Be they faithful

 friends... ...warrant for numerous armed robberies. ...determined advocates... ...or a loving family.

 But occasionally in life, the people we thought would always be there

 for us leave. And if that happens, it's amazing the lengths we'll
