 on \"Desperate Housewives\" The new neighbor... -oh, my god. Katherine. Turned out

 to be an old friend of Susan's... and that pine tree in

 the back yard... it's my pride and joy. Who had a problem

 making new friends. Oh, it absolutely kills me to have to ask

 you to cut it down. Her daughter couldn't recall the past. -

 I'm Julie's mom. - Who's Julie again? Your best friend when you

 were little. But her husband had news for susan. - You're pregnant.

 Lynette revealed her condition. - I have cancer. Gaby and carlos began

 a secret affair. - Can you get away tonight? - Are you

 serious? And edie uncovered a secret of another sort. Why didn't you

 ever tell me About your offshore bank account... the one with $10

 million in it? (Mary alice) the great crime wave hit wisteria lane

 on a tuesday afternoon. That's when residents found their barbecues upended... their

 clean laundry trampled... and their skateboards missing. Naturally, everyone began to ask

 who could be responsible for such carnage. The answer lay in the

 home of a neighbor who, 20 minutes earlier, had been engaging in...

 an altogether different type of crime. Oh, i gotta get back. I

 told edie i was just going for a jog. Do i look

 sweaty enough for a 5-mile run? Yeah. Unfortunately, it's my sweat. Mmm.

 Mmm. When are you gonna dump her? (sighs) it's complicated, okay? Besides,

 i don't see you in any big hurry to dump victor. Generally

 speaking, women don't leave their husbands for guys who have girlfriends. Just

 boot the bitch. What are you afraid of? Hey, i am not

 afraid of... (car door shuts in distance) Oh, my god! What the

 hell's the matter with you? (lowered voice) edie! (edie) gaby, you in

 there? (whispers) okay. (normal voice) one second! Edie! What brings you here?

 I'm looking for carlos. He went for a run, but it was

 hours ago. Sorry. Haven't seen him. Really? Because ida greenberg said that

 she thought she saw him on your porch. Uh, that's impossible, because

 he's there! There he is! What? Carlos! He's at your house. Oh,

 he just let himself in. Oh. There you go. He's home. Okay.

 Well, thanks. You told her i was at home. So? So i'm

 not at home. I'm here. What the hell am i supposed to

 do? Edie! Edie, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Don't go! Don't go! Why?

 Uh, you, uh, have a birthday coming up, and, uh, i don't

 know what to get ya. Or maybe a coffeepot or scented hangers

 or... a nice clock radio. Gaby, i don't have time for this.

 Why don't you just surprise me? Uh, wait, but don't go! (tires

 screech) I-i need a little more guidance! Damn it, boys! You should

 not be screwing around in the streets! Somebody's gonna get hurt! (both

 yelling) Carlos! Can you believe this? Someone broke into our house. Oh,

 my god. And so ended the great crime wave on wisteria lane.

 No one ever found out who was responsible... ew. Honey, you're all

 sweaty. Go clean up. Because it was an inside job. Desperate Housewives

 Season 04 Episode 02 you will never see despair here... (dog barks)

 Or rage. You will never see the tiniest bit of regre you

 see, the people who live here have learned there is one sure

 way of hiding their secrets... hey. From their neighbors. That's why, in

 the suburbs, there is nothing more deceptive than a smile. So what

 did julie say, exactly? She said dylan's not the same girl. Not

 the same girl like she's changed, or not the same girl because

 she's been replaced by a robot? I know it sounds weird, but

 julie says dylan does not remember anything about living here. Well, maybe

 she blocked it out. Did something bahappen to her when she was

 young? I'm not sure. But there was something odd about the way

 they left. So... if it isn't the early morning gossip brigade. Who

 are we dishing today? Uh, susan. She's standing right there. Oh, my

 god. Have you been there this whole time? Anyway, i wanted to

 talk to you girls about lynette. What about her? Well, since she's

 been so tired from chemo, i thought it'd be nice if we

 did something for her, like bring her lunch? Uh, that sounds great.

 Yeah, let's do it. Um, gaby, why don't you bring your vegetable

 lasagna? Susan, you do beverages, and, uh, katherine, why don't you bring

 a simple green salad? I'd rather bring dessert. Oh, no need, dear.

 I always bring dessert. Oh, i'm thinking my lemon meringue pie. Oh,

 yum. Yeah, here's the thing. The movers lost my salad bowl. My

 pie plates, on the other hand... will not be needed. As i

 said, i always bring dessert. I know. I will lend you my

 salad bowl. You really don't wanna miss bree's pie. It's perfect. Who

 am i to argue with perfection? Sorry. It's just, something has been

 driving me crazy. Now you're perfect. D-does it hurt? It's a little

 uncomfortable, but i'm fine. Take a card. Hey, i told you i'm

 collecting queens. Pay attention. You remember we played this when you were

 in labor with parker? 42 hours without meds. I'll never forget what

 a trouper you were. Well, let's not compose my eulogy just yet.

 I'm still troupin'. Take a card. Right. It's funny. We played cards

 on our honeymoon the day that it rained. Do you remember that?

 We... we lit a fire... you're doing it again. Sorry. Hey, i

 told you i'm collecting queens. Shoot. That's right. Oh, my god. Are

 you letting me win? I just wanna make you feel good. By

 taking all the fun t of the kill? Honey, i'm sorry. It's

 just... (voice breaking) I love you so much. Out. What? You are

 supposed to be distracting me, not depressing the hell out of me.

 You're kicking me out of chemo? I'll see you at home. Honey,

 i'm your ride. Just go. I'll cab it. There's that trouper that

 i admire so much. Out! Carlos! Hi! Hey, there's my birthday girl.

 Oh. Mmm! (chuckles) It's a nice car. We got company? No. Then

 whose is it? (chuckles) It's... your birthday present to me. Surprise! A

 car. I was gonna get you earrings. So? Get 'em. And i

 will drive around with the top down so everyone can see them.

 Edie, i can't afford this. Of course you can. Just move some

 of your offshore money onshore. I told you, that account was a

 secret, which it's not gonna be for long if i start buying

 $80,000 cars. Now i'm sensing that this little nest egg of yours

 is a teensy bit illegal. Where'd it come from? You don't need

 to know that, d the i.r.s. Doesn't, either. You want me to

 go to jail? Goodness, carlos. L-i had no idea that your situation

 was so... precarious. Well... i guess i'll just have to take this

 back to the dealership. Thank you for understanding, babe. Look, if... (sighs)

 if you don't want the earrings, just pick something else out instead.

 Just not too extravagant. Don't worry. I have a thought, and it's

 right in your price range. Oh! Hi. Hi. Hey, katherine. What's going

 on? Why is there a moving van in your driveway? Oh, i

 meant to call you. I, uh... it's just been so nuts. I

 got a new job... in chicago. What? You're just leaving, like that?

 I know! It's crazy, huh? I really wish i had time to

 talk, but i gotta finish packing. Oh, whoa. No, hang on. Let

 me just run and get julie so she can say good-bye to

 dylan. Oh, we're really in a rush. I don't think we're gonna

 have time... (glass shatters) Th-that's okay, guys! Keep packing! I'll clean it

 up! Katherine? Are you okay? You seem a little jumpy. I just

 had a-a long night, and l-i have a lot to do. I'm

 really gonna miss you. Katherine, hi. Oh, uh, i brought you that

 salad bowl. Oh, thank you. You're so thoughtful. No problem. Hey, you

 know, i was meaning to ask you, how did that job in

 chicago work out? Job? You know, the one that you left so

 suddenly for. Oh, right. Yes, of course. Uh, good. Uh, it worked

 out well... very challenging. Oh. I've got something in the stove. I've

 gotta go. Oh. Susan. What? I'm eating for two. Well, do both

 of you wanna be fat? Okay, when i'm in labor and i

 am pushing and screaming to bring your child into the world, do

 you really want me to remember that you denied me syrup? Carry

 on. Mom, i need to talk to you about tonight. Oh, my

 god. Is it about matt's party? Yeah. It turns out it doesn't

 start until 10:00, so can i stay out till 1:00? Well, uh,

 well, the johnsons live right down the road. Yeah, i guess that's

 fine. Thanks. Whoa, whoa. Is this the johnsons over on crestview? Yeah.

 Yeah, l-i don't think you should go to that. Why not? Well,

 i've done a couple jobs at that house, and they have some

 really wild parties. I don't even wanna tell you what i've snaked

 out of that toilet. Those re matt's not like that. All 17-year-old

 guys are like that. The only reason my buddies and i even

 had parties was to get girls wasted. Well, i don't drink. Neither

 did missy taylor, and fast-forward to her tying her bra on my

 car antenna. I really appreciate your concern, but my mom already told

 me i could go. (clicks teeth) Well, that's true. Just giving my

 opinion. It's up to your mom. Uh, we... i mean, you both

 make a-a good case. Um... but i think i'm gonna have to

 agree with, uh... and you know i love you both... decide. Mike.

 I'm going with mike. What? Well, it sounds like this party could

 be on the wild side, and it is starting very late. This

 is so unfair. I'm sorry, honey. You wanted aecision. This is my

 decision. More syrup? Missy taylor? Carry on. Look at your little dylan,

 all grown up. Karen mccluskey. I babysat you way back when. You

 were a biter. Well, i hope i didn't hurt you. Nah, you

 were a cutie... but loud. I remember the racket you used to

 make on your tricycle. I gave your dad hell four putting that

 horn on it. My dad? Mm-hmm. How could you know my dad?

 He left when i was a baby. Nah, he used to come

 around once in a while. Anyway, nice to have you back. Please

 let me help. I feel so guilty just sitting here. Do not

 move. We want to pamper you, so please let us. Thank you.

 Hey, so how's the chemotherapy going? Oh, no, no. She doesn't want

 to talk about that. I don't mind. Oh, come on. Let's dig

 in to the pie. Looks amazing. Wow. Oh, my god. Bree, that

 is, like, the best pie you've ever made. Well, thank you. I

 don't think i did anything differently. This is not my pie. (laughs)

 okay, you caught me. It's mine. What happened to the pie that

 i brought? Oh, i was a little sneaky, and i put it

 in the fridge. I just wanted you to try mine. Well, did

 we or did we not agree that i would bring the dessert?

 I know, but everyone says you're such an amazing baker, and i

 was hoping you would give me some tips to improve my recipe.

 Well, clearly no tips are needed. As my friends said, \"best pie

 ever made.\" Well, then perhaps you shouldn't have said anything. I would

 have been happy for everyone to think it was yours. So back

 to chemo... how's that been? Yeah, so far... not that bad. Though

 i did have to kick tom out yesterday. Why? He was getting

 so emotional. It felt like the last 20 minutes of \"brian's song.\"

 So... i guess i'm in the market for a new chemo buddy.

 Well, i would be more than happy to go with you. Count

 me in. I'll sit with you. I volunteer at the hospital, so

 i'll be there anyway. Oh! My god, you guys. I'm so touched

 you're all willing to do this. What are friends for? Gaby? ???

 Staged your lemon meringue pie? You've gotta be kidding. I'm not. That

 despicable woman was just supposed to bring a simple green salad. She

 not only brought a pie... she hid mine and served hers. Well,

 that's beyond despicable. That's culinary terrorism. Oh, it gets worse. Her pie

 was better than mine. (mixer whirring) Impossible. It's true. Everyone thought so.

 Even me. Oh, and that simple green salad... mache and baby arugula

 with duck confit and candied walnuts! My god, she plays to win.

 I have been here for hours trng to replicate her recipe, and

 nothing has even comclose! Don't be so hard on yourself. This one's

 fantastic. That's hers! Sorry. Orson, what am i gonna do? You might

 have to bite the bullet and ask her for her recipe. What?

 Surrender? Debase myself? Bree, it's your signature pie. You make it for

 parties, church suppers, bake sales. If she's always right there behind you

 with her superior version, staking out her claim as fairview's number one

 homemaker... she will have stolen my entire identity. Well, i wouldn't go

 that far. No, it's true. The only thing about me that's special

 is what i can do in the kitchen. You're right. I have

 got to get that recipe... by any means necessary. Hey, gaby. Hey,

 what's up? Well... i felt a little weird about something that happened

 at lunch, and i thought we should talk about it. I know.

 Do you believe that pie business? I thought bree's head was gonna

 explode. (chuckles)o, not that. Okay, i don't know how to say this,

 so i'm just gonna say it. When everyone was offering to come

 with me to chemo... even katherine, who i don't even know, you

 sort of clammed up. What was that about? Well, it just seemed

 like people had it pretty well covered. Yeah, but between us, you're

 the onel really want there. Out of everyone, you're the most fun,

 and i need that now. Oh, that's sweet. But to be honest,

 i don't like hospitals. Nobody likes hospitals. Unfortunately, that's the place you

 have to go when you're sick, or your friends are. You are

 my friend, right? What, is this a test of our friendship? Yeah...

 kinda. Can i pencil you in? I can't wait. (lowered voice) psst!

 Come here. Okay, i'll come there. Are you still mad at me

 about the party? Oh, you picked up on that, did you? Okay,

 look, i've been thinking about things, and... (whispers) just forget what i

 said earlier. (loudly) You mean i can go? Shh! Jeez! Ooh, mike's

 in the other room. You're not gonna tell him? No, and neither

 are you. (scoffs) why are you walking on eggshells? You are my

 mother. You have every right to override him. I know. I just...

 i think it's sweet that he worries about you, and i want

 him to feel like he's part of the decision making process. Well,

 clearly he's not if you're going behind his back. Do you wanna

 go or not? Yes! Yes, i really wanna go to the party.

 Party? You guys still talking about that? (sighs) can you believe it?

 Ugh! Let it go. You know, mike and i decided... no party,

 and that's final. Bree. I hope this isn't a bad time. I

 just wanted to bring you a housewarming gift. It's the recipe for

 my special mincemeat pie. It wouldn't be thanksgiving at my house without

 it. Well... aren't you thoughtful? Let me just file this in my

 recipe box. Well, as long as we're swapping pie recipes, i would

 love the one for your fabulous lemon meringue. Really? I'm so flattered

 you'd ask. But i don't share that. Excuse me? You have to

 understand... i experimented for years before i came up with my secret

 ingredient. Which is what? Vanilla? Nutmeg? Cardamom? If i told you, it

 wouldn't be a secret anymore. It would just be an ingredient. Well,

 that, um, hardly seems neighborly. After all, i just gave you the

 recipe for my mincemeat pie. Yes, and it's a very good one.

 I have the book it came from. That recipe is not from

 a book. That recipe was handed down to me from my mother.

 Well, unless your mother was betty crocker, she got it from a

 book. Oh, dear. Now i've upset you. No. No, i am not

 upset. I'm just confused as to why you seem so determined to

 get off on the wrong foot. First you bring a pie to

 lynette's, when i clearly assigned you the salad... now, see, that's where

 i'm confused. Just what, please, gives you the right to decide who

 brings what to a luncheon that i suggested? Well, it's tradition. I

 always organize our little get-togethers, and i always bring dessert. Well, then

 how lovely that i'm back and can shouer that burden for you.

 Just... give me the recipe! Sorry. I can't. I do hope this

 doesn't keep us from being friends, because i like you, bree. And

 i'm sure if you put your mind to it, you can come

 up with an even better lemon meringue pie than mine. The trick

 is finding that perfect blend of sweet and sour. Well, you've certainly

 mastered that, dear. So when do i get to see my big

 surprise? Wait for it. Wait for it. Ta-da. Whoa. All that syrup

 went straight to your boobs. So it's not my imagination. They're bigger,

 right? Uh, yeah. Especially the right one. Mike! Just kidding. Pick those

 up and bring 'em over here. Well, i'd better warn you. I

 may have to work the shoulders. Mmm. Hey. That thing with julie

 and the party this morning... mm-hmm? Thanks for backing me up. It

 meant a lot, and i know it wasn't easy for you. Uh,

 yeah, well, you know, sometimes you gotta hang tough. Mm, well, you

 did the right thing. I drove by that house tonight. Mm-hmm? That

 party was out of control. What? Yeah, there were kids staggering around

 drunk... puking in the gutter, and then i saw some girls running

 around topless. I'm sure the cops will be there any minute. We

 need whipped cream. What? Well i don't think that you can have

 sexy date night without whipped cream. Can't and won't. Well, i... i

 can go get some. No, no, you've, uh, worked all day. You

 stay here. I'll go to the store. Could you get more syrup?

 Make a wish. So i'm dying to see what i got you.

 How thoughtful was i? Very. Open it. \"Yes!\" Not yet. I haven't

 asked the question. Will you marry me, carlos solis? And you say...

 you're proposing? You said you didn't want to spend too much. So

 what's more affordable than a promise? Look, edie... i'm doing this for

 you. If the i.r.s. Gets wind of your... rainy day fund, they

 could make me testify against you. But if i were your wife...

 how are they going to find out? Oh, honey, people talk... angry

 people, disappointed people. Come on. Say your line. It's my birthday. Fine.

 We're engaged. Oh! Carlos! I think i'm gonna cry. Yeah, me, too.

 I mean, how weird is that? My mom always told methat my

 dad took off right after i was born. So did she explain

 what mccluskey said? I didn't tell her. She kinda freaks out anytime

 i bring him up. Dylan, you have a right to know about

 your dad. You've got to confront her. Yeah, right. I could never

 do that. She isn't cool like your mom. Hi. It's my birthday.

 Oh, that must mean you're matt. I'm susan mayer, and i'm... all

 righty. You magnificent bastard! You actually did it! It wasn't me, but

 happy birthday, man. Well, it was somebody. Who cares? Gather 'round, men.

 So you like this music? Ah, it's fine. Would somebody just tell

 me where i can find... hey, enough talking. Just take it off.

 We're feeling generous tonight. Oh, my god! I'm not a stripper. You're

 not? Is this gonna happen or what? Boomer, she's not a stripper.

 What's with the implants? I'm pregnant. That's hot. Sorry. Should've known you

 were julie's mom. You're way too gorgeous to be a stripper. If

 that's your lame attempt to keep me from calling your parents... it

 worked. Well played. Excuse me. Oh. Aah! Uh, uh... mom, what are

 you doing here? I am taking you home. This party is out

 of control. No, it's not. Well, of course you don't think it

 is because yore knocking back a big cup of... mm... orange soda.

 I don't believe this. Well, believe it. We're going. You, too, dylan.

 Come on. And what are you wearing? It's embarrassing. Yeah, well, boomer

 likes it. Call me tomorrow. We'll go to a movie my mom

 can drag us out of. Look, i get that you're upset. No,

 i'm confused. First, i can go to the party, then i can't

 because mike says no. Then i can, but \"don't tell mike and

 behave yourself.\" So i behave myself, and you punish me. Okay, i

 admit that there's a certain lack of consistency there. It's like... ever

 since you got married, i can't win. Do you think this is

 easy for me? Trying to keep peace between a new husband and

 a teenage daughter? You're always putting me in the middle. Ugh. I

 don't do that. Please. Every time you and mike disagree on something,

 you give me the look... that pitiful face that says if i

 don't back you up, i love the other one more. I don't

 expect you to side with me every time. Just make a decision

 and stick to it. And no more lying. Well, you're right. I'm

 an adult, and i need to be honest about these things, and

 i will be... starting tomorrow. Hey. Look who i picked up coming

 out of the movies... a p.g. Movie. Is this the perfect teenager

 or what? Oh, the movies, huh? That's funny. 'Cause one of julie's

 friends just called to make sure she got home from the party.

 She was worried when she saw you leaving with a stripper. The

 jig is up, mom. No, no, we can salvage this. Just work

 with me. I did go to the party. Mom went behind your

 back and told me i could. But l-i didn't drink or do

 anything i shouldn't have. Glad to hear it, and, uh, thanks for

 your honesty. You know, this perfect teenager thing is really starting to

 chap my ass. I'm going to bed. Please tell me this isn't

 gonna be one of those things where you leave me and i

 go screaming down the street. Why'd you go behind my back? I'm

 sorry. You gotta understand, for so long, it's just been julie and

 me, and i've made all the decisions alone. You felt so strongly.

 It was just an opinion, really. She's your daughter. I completely respect

 your right to raise her however you want. Thanks. Now that being

 said, this baby is ours. So we'll get to make all those

 parenting decisions together, right? Right. So can we go back to date

 night? Ly if you work the shoulders. Oh. Mmm. Gaby, where have

 you been? You went to the bathroom, like, half an hour ago.

 Oh, sorry. I stopped off to get you some magazines. \"Top ten

 new hairstyles.\" Yeah, well, i'm kinda bald right now, but thanks. Why

 n't i go check if there are some other ones? No, no,

 i don't need magazines. I need you've been bouncing around since you

 got here. So... how do you like being the first lady of

 fairview? It's good. Are you cold? They keep it cold in here.

 I'm fine. So tell me something. When you go to a ribbon

 cutting, do you get to keep those gigantic novelty scissors? You must

 be freezing. You know, i have the cutest shawl in the car,

 so i'm just gonna run out and get it for you. Boy,

 you really don't wanna be here, do ya? What are you talking

 about? I'm trying to help. Yeah, in any way that gets you

 out of this room. I'm sorry. It's just hospitals are hard for

 me. Yeah, you told me, but, jeez, gaby, don't you care enough

 to make an effort? You think i don't care? I get it.

 You're uncomfortable. Just go. I'm fine. I'm fine. Did i ever tell

 you about my father? He had cancer, too. Started in the liver,

 went into his bones, and ten months later, he was dead. Thanks

 for that encouraging story. I'm not finished. Those last weeks, every day

 we thought we were gonna lose him. And every day, before i

 would go into his room, my mom would say, \"no tears. \"Daddy

 wants to see you smiling. If you're gonna cry, you can't go

 in.\" So... on the last night... i sat there and i watched

 him die. His eyes were closed, but i thought he could still

 see me. So i kept smiling... all night. I was 5. Oh,

 my god. But on the plus side, i made a pretty good

 career out of knowing how to smile when i didn't really feel

 like it. (sniffles) But i can't pretend with you. Not when i'm

 scared i'm gonna lose you. You're not gonna lose me. You promise?

 'Cause if i did... then... (laughs) God! I'm such a mess. It's

 okay. Come here. Let it go. Oh. (katherine) honey? I'm going to

 get adam. Be right back. ?? Can i talk to you about

 something? Sure. If you don't mind talking in the car. Bree hodge

 persisted in her effor to unlocthe secret of katherine mayfair's lemon meringue.

 But after several failed attempts, it occurred to bree that while she

 might not have the key to katherine's recipe... she did have the

 key... to katherine's house. Oh, hey, what's up? I was doing a

 little baking, and i was wondering if i could borrow something. Sure.

 What do you need... flour, sugar? You can't believe what karen mccluskey

 tells you. She's an old woman... practically senile. She didn't sound senile

 to me. Dylan, maybe this is not the time, okay? You said

 my father didn't care about me, but she says he came here.

 He wanted to see me. Why wod you not tell me that?

 He's my father. I deserve to know. The only thing you need

 to know about that man is he was a monster. I can

 decide that for myself. Where is he? I don't know. You're lying.

 No, she's not. Yes, she is. She has been lying to me

 my whole life. I'm starting to think maybe you're the monster. She

 can't talk to me that way, not after everything i've done for

 her. Well, maybe that's the problem. She doesn't know what you've done

 for her. Nobody does, and it's gonna stay that way. Are you

 sure? She's just gonna keep asking questions. Then we'd better start coming

 up with better lies. Oh, there you are. I was wondering where

 you'd gone to. I just let myself into katherine's house to get

 that recipe. Well, that seems a bit extreme. Well, at least you

 know her secret now. Yes, and it has nothing to do with

 pie. Ahh. Here's the thing. I got a real chance at getting

 back together with my ex, but this woman is standing in my

 way. And she knows about the money, and she's made it clear

 that if i leave, she's gonna blow the whistle. You gotta understand...

 i really did care for edie, but i can't let her ruin

 my life. That's where you come in. You guys, we better behave,

 or the nurses are gonna kick us out. Hey, it's our chemo

 party, and we'll laugh if we want to. Gaby, this was a

 wonderful idea. I cannot tell you how much it means to me.

 Well, don't get sappy on me. I won't stand for it. All

 right, susan, is the camera ready? Yeah. Got it. Okay, once the

 light starts blinking, we've got three seconds, so, everybody, say, \"cheese\" and

 holdt. Okay. One, two, three. (all) cheese! There is nothing more deceptive

 than a smile, and no one knows this better than the people

 who hide behind them. Some flash their teeth as a polite warning

 to their enemies. Some put on beaming faces to keep their tears

 from falling. Others wear silly grins to mask their fear. Mm! But

 then there is that rare smile that is actually genuine. I'll take

 care of it. It's the smile of a person who knows his
