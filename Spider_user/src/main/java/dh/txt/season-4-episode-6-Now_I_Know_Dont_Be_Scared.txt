 on... Danielle came back home. Lynette was afraid for her children... It

 feels like I've ruined their childhood. Katherine's past... We know all about

 chicago. Came back to haunt her. Oh, good. We're in agreement. The

 fountain stays. Edie made thats... If the i.r.s. Gets wind of your

 rainy day nd, they could make me testify against you. But evasive

 action was taken. I want us to be together, too, but I

 also wanna feel good and Gaby and Carlos ended their affair... Too

 late. Could you make it out to \"cash\"? (Mary alice)\u0002as a little

 girl, ritt was afraid of many things, ???? So they would wait

 for her\u0002with rubber snakes and croaking frogs... (ribbit) and plastic spiders, hoping

 to make edie scream. But once she was a big girl, edie

 britt was afraid\u0002of only one thing-- that her lover might leave her

 for someone else, and carlos solis knew this. So when he decided

 to go,\u0002he tried to do it quickly... What the hell is this?

 Mostly to avoid her screaming. It just hasn't been working for a

 long, longime. (sighs) that's a lie. We were ppy. Come on. L's

 not argue. I want us to end this as friends. I t

 you do, given all I know about your finances. That's true. You

 know some of my secrets, but I'm betting you still care enough

 about me to keep them. All right. I won't say anything to

 anyone about your money in the grand caymans on one condition-- You

 have to tell me the truth about why you're leaving. The truth?

 Is there someone else? no. Thank you, carlos. You made this a

 lot easier. Ye edie britt had been forced\u0002to face her worst fear,

 and she now felt\u0002it was only fair... hi. Um, i know a

 guy who's got millions in a offshore bank account. Who would I

 talk to about that? That carlos should face his. ????Ļ????ѧϰ???????Ͻ???????ҵ??; - =????????Ļ??=-

 ????: У??: ʱ???᣺?ػ???ʹ - ==http://www.ragbear.com==- ???????????? ???ļ???6?? yes, it was that time

 of year. Halloween had come once again\u0002to wisteria lane, and no one

 was more determined\u0002to celebrate its arrival than the gay couple\u0002who had just

 moved in. So which of the neighbors should we invite first? What

 does it matter? They all hate us? Oh, lee, that's not true.

 They hate you. I'm the butch one they can feel comfortable around.

 You keep telling yourself that. Let's start with bree. She's got a

 gay son. I bet she's homo-friendly. Why? My mother has one, and

 she's not. hi. Oh, hello. We're just dropping by to let you

 know we're having a halloween party. We'd! love for you to come.

 Oh, well, thank you. Orson and I would be delighted. Well, you

 can bring your whole family if you like. Is that your daughter?

 Uh, no,my daughter is in switzerland, at boarding school. Who was that?

 My son... Trying on his costume. He's going to be cher this

 year. Okay, he's definitely invited. How many times have I told you

 to stay away from the windows? I'm bored. You won't let me

 go outside. Can't I at least look? At's that? Oh, we've been

 invited to bob and lee's for halloween. A costume party. Cool. Can

 I go? Are you insane? It's halloween. I'll go as a pumpkin.

 You are due in three weeks. Until then, no windows and no

 parties. (sighs) so... This is gonna be fun. Will you help me

 with a costume? (chuckles) sure! How familiar are you withop icons from

 the '70s? Victor, it's me. I got your message. I've gotta be

 honest, I'm very annoyed that you're not coming home today like you

 promised. I told you I have something very important to tell you,

 and I want to do it in person, but now you're gonna

 be home for another week, and I can't wait. Victor,i'm leaving you.

 I... Can't believe I'm ending my marriage on a hotel voice mai

 this is very tacky. You're forcing me to be tacky, victor. I

 am not a tacky person. I am very, very classy. (line clicks)

 oh! Hang on one second. Hello? Hey, carlos. Yeah, i can't talk

 right now. I'm breaking up with victor. No, he's not here. He's

 in washington. Yeah, okay,i'll explain later. Sorry about that, victor. Uh, anyway,

 it's over. Uh, we both know it wasn't working. Uh, good luck

 on everything, and you don't have to call me back. Okay, bye-bye.

 ah. I was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling. I didn't

 have to do that with my last baby. Well, you were 26

 ???? Now you're-- Careful. Old enough to benefit from this particunar branch

 of medicine. Nice save. Now can we just skip to the part

 where you tell me what's wrong with my baby? Well, we don't

 know if anything's wrong. See, we're just going over your family medical

 history just--just to be on the safe side. Okay. My aunt ella

 has arthritis. I have two cousins with webbed feet, and there's a

 whole apparently, i married into carny folk. (chuckles) okay, mike, what about

 your family? Everybody's pretty healthy. Uh, my grandther has epilepsy. My father

 had high blood pressure, on medication, so it's fine now. What do

 you mean ???? 'cause that's what you told me when we first

 started dating. Oh. Well,i'm sorry if I gave you that impression. It

 wasn't an impression. You sa (chuckles nervously) it's... Complicated. How can it

 be complicated? He's either dead or alive. Does it sound complicated to

 you, michelle? (cell phone buzzing) oh, um... Wow,i'm sorry. I-I've got an

 emergency plumbing call. I'm gonna have to do this later. Uh, don't

 wait up. Okay, so,um, mike's grandmother is epileptic? Yeah. But apparently, his

 dad can rise from the dead. So let's hope the baby gets

 that gene. Hey. How'd the p.e.t. Scan go? She was a real

 trouper. 20 minutes inside that tube, she didn't complain once. In a

 couple of days, we'll know if you beat this son of a

 bitch. Hey, dr. Rushton is very optimistic. (stella) fantastic. He's the best.

 Hey, what do you say I ditch work, and I take you

 to that... Thai place for lunch? Lynette? Is that a hole? What?

 In the garden there. Has something been digging in there? Oh, it

 might be a possum. Ahem. I-I saw one the other day. ????

 Didn't know it was front-page news. Well, we gotta do something about

 this. And we will, so do you want to bring the kids,

 or would you prefer a, uh,gloriously romantic lunch with just me? I

 can't eat right now, tom. I've got to go to the garden

 center and get some fencing. God, this is annoying! Can't believe you

 didn't tell me we have a possum! Oh, you're, um, you're up.

 I was just gonna try not to wake you. Did you really

 think I was gonnalet you without an mxplanation for your bizarre behavior?

 Well, what good's a dream ???? I don't care what the issues

 are. You don't deny your own dad's existence. My father's in prison

 for murder. So can you see why I might have wanted to

 lie about him on a first date? Oh, my god. He's in

 jail for m yeah. He's doing life without parole. Do you see

 him? I mean, do you have a relationship with him? Uh, i

 visit a few times a year. Well, I've got to meet him.

 (chuckles) no, i don't think that's such a good idea. Well, he's

 your father. I should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor said

 we should gher data about your family's history. Maybe you dad knows

 something you don't. I mean, i should meet him r the sake

 of our baby. Well, yeah. Fine. We'll go see him. Thank you.

 Mom! We're gonna bake you a cake when the doctor says your

 cancer's gone. Great. Here. Grab this. What's this stuff for? You know

 that possum that's been ruining our garden? Yeah, me and preston named

 him scruffles. Don't give him a name. He's not gonna be around

 much longer. You're not gonna hurt him, are you? Honey, i put

 up a fence, and he burrowed right under it. The man at

 the garden center said these are crafty creatures, and there's only one

 way to stop 'em. So you're gonna kill h? Sweetie, let me

 ask you something. If you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden

 and a gross, mean, dirty possum, what scruffles. Okay, we're done talking

 here. You're sending me back to the convent? Well, you certainly don't

 seem happy here, and I thought maybe you were missing the nuns

 and the other girls. Oh, whoopee. Knocked-up sluts and celibate freaks. Start

 the party. (sighs) whatever. I don't care. I just want this thing

 out of me. You know, danielle, I just want you to be

 aware that giving up this baby might be harder than you think.

 It won't be a problem. Trust me. Well, you say that now,

 but once you've held your child and felt that rush of love,

 well... It can change you. Please. I hate this baby. What has

 it done but make me fat and ruin an enre year of

 my life? I'm just saying, if I were you, I might be

 feeling-- Stop. Who says I have to feel the same things you'd

 feel? I'm nothing like you. You always s that like it's something

 to be p but the day I see even a glimmer of

 myself in you is the day that I realize you've finally started...

 (whispers) to grow up. Well, don't hold your breath. No, on second

 thought, do. Hello, gabrielle. oh! (panting) milton... You scared me. I thought

 you were in washington with victor. I was. I got to the

 messages first. Oh. You can't leave him, gabrielle. Well, if he really

 wanted me to stay, he would've come here himself, instead of siccing

 daddy on me. Oh, victor hasn't heard the message. I erased it.

 Oh, great. Now I have to break up with him all over

 again. You know, there's a lot of talk about victor running for

 governor. A divorce on the eve of a campaign could be... ite

 And you flew all the way here to twist my arm? No,

 i had something a little more subtle in mind. Milton, there is

 no amount of money that is--wow! Yeah. You start tacking on those

 zeros, it gets hard to stop. Hold on. This check is dated

 for next year. Exactly. If you want this money, you're gonna have

 to stay married to my son for the next 13 months. Huh.

 And isn't there an election around that time? My son is destined

 for greatness. He will be governor. He could be president. And you're

 going to make sure he goes straight to the top, aren't you?

 Sometimes greatness needs a little nudge. What do you mean, there's nothing

 there? I'm sorry, ms. Britt. I checked the number you gave me

 three times. That offshore account simply doesn't exist. Where is that $10

 million? What $10 million? Gi? (loudly) first of all, I deny having

 any illegal money, let alone moving it. Why are you talking like

 that? I don't know. I thought you might be wearing a wire.

 (slaps hand) you're paranoid. You know that? Well, don't I have reason

 to be? And why would you care where the money is, unless

 you were planning on using it against me? Oh, god. You think

 you are so clever. Well, you're no in fact, you--you are the

 stupidest man I've ever met. You have no clue who you're dealing

 with, but believe me, you're gonna pay for what you've done to

 me, carlos. This game is not over. Actually, it kinda is, and

 if you hadn't noticed... I won. Bree. Lynette, I was just thinking

 about you. Did you get your test results yet? Huh? O the

 p.e. Scan. No, not till tomorrow. Listen, i need your help. There's

 a possum in my garden. Ugh! I hate possums. Not as much

 as me. I put out poison, but it ate around it. I

 got one ofse hs, but all I trapped was penny. How can

 I help? I want a gun. Really? I thought you were one

 of those liberal gun haters. That was the old lynette. The new

 lynette kills the possums and lets god sort 'em out. Well, unfortunately,

 our bleeding-heart town council forbids us fm using live ammo in our

 own backyards. Wusses! I suggest you get an air rifle. It won't

 kill it, but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for

 good. Perfect. Where can I get one? Try, u gun city on

 route 6 by the baptist church. Tell them I sent ya, and

 they'll give youa nice discount. Great. What's so urgent? Can't say hello

 to a girl? Gaby, we had a deal. We weren't gonna see

 each other for six months. Oh, uh,yeah, about that what if we

 make it 13? Okay, no, just go with me on this. What

 I'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom and... Help

 a conniving billionaire's dream come true. Whoa. What's this for? Milton lang

 doesn't want me to leaveictor until after he runs for governor. Once

 the election's over, ka-ching! So basically, you're taking money to sleep with

 a man you don't love. Gee, f that were a job, what

 w I don't have to sleep with him, just stay with him

 for fofofocal reasons. It's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo

 op. Absolutely not. Carlos, you're not working right now, and you know

 we'll never be happy if we're broke. We need this. What if

 we didn't? Huh? What if I had some money stashed away? Okay,

 remember a few years ago when I was in business with tanaka?

 I was always afraid that he was gonna double-cross me. Which he

 did. But before he did, I skimmed a little off the top.

 How much is \"a littl $10 million. You embezzled $10 million? (kissing

 loudly) mmm. Actually, now it's only about $9.5. It cost me half

 a mil to hide it from the government and certain other people.

 Mm. Oh, wait, wait, wait. If this is tanaka money, then you

 had it when we were married? Okay, i can sense where you're

 going with this. Which also means you had it when we got

 divorced. Look, if I had told you about it, you'd have taken

 me to the cleaners. Carlos, we were married. I was entitled to

 half of everything you embezzmed. Look, we're back together now. What does

 it matter? Well, it matters that you lied to me. I can't

 trust you. Gaby! If I can't trust you, i don't think I

 can be with you. Oh, come on! No,i'm serious. After everything I

 have been through? No! No, get out! Gaby, you should be happy

 right now. I have millions of dollars, and I want you to

 be with me. Oh, so you want me to sleep with you

 and take your money. Gee, if thatere a job, what would they

 call it? Thanks, kid. Bear claw? Uh, no. Thank you, so, uh,mike

 said you had some medical questions for me? Um, yes, the, uh,

 genetic counselor, um,wanted to know a couple of things. Uh... Um,i-is there

 any cancer in your family? no. Great. Uh, diabetes? Mnh-mnh. Wonderful. Who

 did you kill? Couldn't have covered this in the car? I thought

 she ould hear it from you. I killed my boss. Uh-huh. Okay.

 He wasn't my boss when I met him. He was just another

 guy on the loading dock, like me. A supervisor's job came up,

 and, uh,we were both angling for it. And then arnie-- that was

 his name-- He went to the head of the company and told

 him some lies about me, and he got the job. So you

 killed him? No. I stewed about it for a few weeks. I'd

 see arnie walking around with that smirk, and, uh,and that tie, and

 I thought to myself, \"you k \"you don't deserve that tie, and

 you don't deserve to live.\" So you killed him? No. I confronted

 him. I said,\"arnie, what you did wasn't right.\" He just laughed in

 my face and said, uh, \"what are you gonna do about it?\"

 then I killed him. Uh-huh. Uh, and how did you... With the

 tie. I thought it was a nice touch. Well, now you know.

 Hey, adam, katheri. Or should I say frankenstein and... Marie antoinette? Nice

 you came as a self-important queen who lost all h isn't that

 a bit on the nose? Lee making jokes about a queen. Isn't

 that a bit ironic? ???? (both chuckle) and who are you supposed

 to be? Cher, the belove (chuckles) it was my mom's idea. You

 know, the woman who freaked when she found out I was gay?

 oh. Oh, my god. Is that danielle? I expressly forbade her from

 coming tonight. Who does she think she is? Apparently, you. Danielle, you're

 back! (imitating bree) I'? I am bree van de kamp hodge. (chuckles)

 oh, no,no, no. No hugs, please. I'm uncomfortable with needless displays of

 emotion. Your costume looks great. It's so real. Ooh! I could swear

 I felt a kick. (chuckles) you stop that, baby hodge. We do

 not kick people, unless? (chuckles nervously) why didn't you tell me she

 was home? Oh, it's just a quick visit. She's driving back tomorrow.

 To switzernd? Let's go get some cake, dear. What do you think

 you're doing? Exactly what my moth wants. You did say to be

 more like you, right? That's not what I meant, and you know

 it, and as for your little imitation of me, I don't sound

 anything like that. Danielle? Who are you supposed to be? Really, karen,

 I don't think our lord is amused when we make light of

 witchcraft, and you might use a coaster. Oh, i get it. She's

 you. I just don't see how he could not feel bad about

 it. I don't want to talk about this anymore. You know, I

 expected to meet a guy that was racked with rmmorse, and instead,

 i'm looking across the table at this... Person. He's a person. Yeah,

 an evil person. No, he's a good guy who did an evil

 thing. There's a difference. Well, i don't see one. Look, he snapped.

 It happens. People snap. I did. I killed a guy. You killed

 a cro ???? That's self-defense, and even so, you regret it, right?

 Yes, of course. Well, that's my t.d people snap, they feel bad

 about it. Your dad doesn. Sun, why are you getting so worked

 up over this? I don't know. It just bothers me. I mean...

 My god, mike. He's yr dad. I know. And this conversation is

 exactly why I told you he was dead. Lynette! Honey, are you

 out here? Shh! Is that for the possum? Yeah. Now he's playing

 mind games with me, but I laid out some halloween candy. Pretty

 soon he'll get hungry, and when trick or treat. Lynette-- Shh! Shh!

 Do you hear that? He's making his move. Lynette, I think you

 should come inside and lie down for a little while. No way.

 He's here, tom. I can tell. Okay, now--now you're scaring me. Why?

 Look at yourself. You've--you've declared jihad on a possum. This is not

 a joke, tom. Something has attacked our home, and when that happens,

 you don't just stand by--you fight it. Sc? And is trying to

 destroy us. It will not defeat me. Okay. You do what you

 need to do. Thank you. So, bree, have you, uh,picked a name

 for the baby yet? Not yet, but I'm thinking \"you're not good

 enough\" if it's a boy, and \"you'll always disappoint me\" if it's

 a girl. Okay, you made your point. Now go home. Are you

 kidding me? This is the most fun I've had in eight months.

 Do not test me, young lady, or I will drag you out

 of here myself. You make a scene? Ha! That's a laugh. What's

 wrong? I think my wer just broke. Oh, dear heavenly lord. (bob)

 hey! What happened to my rug? Danielle! We agreed to save that

 till the end of the night. The best part of the costume,

 and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking. Orson!

 Andrew! Think we can make it to the hospital? I don't think

 so! It's coming. Okay, everybody, in the house now. Not on the

 couch. I just had it reupholstered. Andrew, take your sister into the

 kitchen. Get some towels. Boil some water. Everything is gonna be fine.

 I'm a doctor. You're a dentist! What if there are complications? Should

 an emergency arise, we will simply call an amulet. A what? ????

 How many rum punches did you have? There was punch in that

 rum? I am going back to get adam. Bree. Bree, what's wrong?

 I need your services as a doctor, but before I tell you

 what's going on, I need you to promise that what you're about

 to learn will be kept in strictest confidence. Does this have anything

 to do with the pregnancy you've been faking? Okay, you're almost there.

 Aah! ???? (parker) are they home? (preston) the lights are on. Here

 it comes! If they're not home, then what's that? Probably just a

 tapethey put on well, you know the rule. If we don't get

 our treat, they get a trick. Yeah. (porter) come on. (giggles) (baby

 wailing) and... Thank you. Oh. (pants) okay. It's a beautiful baby boy.

 How are you feeling? Tired. Did adam leave? Uh, yeah, and he

 promised that no one would ever know what happened here tonight. That's

 good, i guess. Is he okay? ???? He's, um, he's all cleaned

 up now, if... If you want to hold him. Yeah. He's so

 tiny. He looks just like you did. Do you want to be

 alone? Do you want me to... To go? What should I do?

 Yoshould take him. Are you sure? Sweethea? No, it's... The right thing

 to do for everyone... Especially him but you're right. It's awful. I'm

 gonna sleep w. Okay, baby. It's okay, little on here we are.

 Here we go. Yes, here we go. Susan, hey, it's me. Um,

 sorry to leave this message on your machine, but can you tell

 the other girls i'm, uh,going to be by myself for a while?

 I... Just... Going through some stuff and need to think. Um--oh, god,

 that's my car ready to take me to the airport, so I'll

 tell you everything when I get back. Okay? Love you. Bye. This

 is nice. I didn't order a stretch, but I'll take it. Victor.

 I tried reaching you at the house, but the maid said you'd

 moved out. I took the next flight home. What's going on? Well,

 I'm... Sort of leaving you. Well, i guess \"sort of\" is better

 than \"definitely.\" What do I have to do to make it \"absolutely

 not\"? I'll do anything. Just tell me. Victor, it's not that simple.

 We have major problems, and you nevehave time to talk about them,

 let alone fix 'em. Well, i guess better make some time. Let's

 see. Here's this weekend. Here's next week. The week after. Look at

 that. I've got a whole month. You busy? Victor, i know you're

 only doing this because a divorce would hurt your run for governor.

 What if I don't run? You mean that? The governor's mansion is

 my father's dream. You know what my dream I' you. Don't run

 away, gaby... And if you do, please, take me with you so...

 Where's mike? At the motel. I slipped out without waking him. I've

 been up all night thinking, and I have something to say to

 you. oh? I don't believe you. I don't believe that you could

 kill a man and not regret it. Why do you care? Because

 I am carrying a baby that has your genes. If my doctor

 told me that there was something wrong with this baby-- something physical,

 I could handle that. I would pr but if my baby was

 born without a conscience, without a soul, I don't know what I

 would do. You think I don't have a soul? If you can't

 feel the tiniest bit of remse over taking a human life... No,

 i don't think you do. If I were to think about what

 I did, really think about it, lay awake nights trying to remember

 the look on that guy's face when I strangled the life out

 of him... Pretty soon,i'd go crazy. I should go. You know what

 I do regret? What I did to mike. What did youo? He

 was a real popular kid. Everybody liked mikey. (clicks tongue) then when

 I got sent away, suddenly the whole town just thinks of him

 as the son of a murderer. ???? I'm not re that kind

 of darkness ever truly goes away. Well, you're wrong. He's happy. He's

 got a good job and a wife who loves him and a

 baby on the way. I had a lot going for me, too,

 before I t just... Keep on eye on him. Edie, if you're

 looking for gaby, she just left for her yoga class. Yoga... Is

 that what she told you? I'm sorry. I know how angry and

 humiliated you must feel. But don't take it all out on gaby.

 Carlos seduced her. He hated you for taking his wife, so he

 decided to make a fool out of you. I think he deserves

 whatever's coming to him, don'v you? Hey! Hey! Hey, quiet. She's napping.

 Finally. How'd you get her to do that? oh, ???? ???? Hmm,

 it's Dr. Rushton. Her oncologist? Hey. Hey, dr. Rushton. What--what are you

 doing here? Well... (sighs) so much of my job is delivering bad

 news, that I really wanted to tell you this in person. Lynette,

 i got the test results back. You're clean. Are you sure? Yeah.

 (stglla) oh! Lymph nodes are completely clear. Congratulations. I knew it. I

 knew it! Did you hear that? Did you hear that this is

 so amazing. I'm gonna go get the kids. Hey, doc, you look

 like you need a margarita. (laughing) and even if you don't, I

 ain't drinng alone. (voice breaks) I'm sorry. There is much\u0002to be afraid

 of in this world, but what we fear\u0002has nothing to do with

 gruesome masks or plastic spiders or lifelike monsters. No, it's the thoughts

 that terrify us the most... What if she comes to regret\u0002her decision?

 what i\u0002he really is unhappy? what if the chance for love\u0002has passed

 forever? how do we conquer\u0002these terrifying thoughts? we start by reminding ourselves
