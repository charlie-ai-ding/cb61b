 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: [screaming] [Lynette] I will love her like

 she is my own. Lynette made a promise. [Susan] His wife goes

 missing, his mistress turns up dead? I can't believe that Orson could

 do such a thing. - Mike got arrested. - Oh, thank God.

 - A friendship hit the rocks. - [Susan] I won't play with

 a woman that will let Mike take the fall for her psycho

 husband. Susan made a deal. [Ian] I'll hire the best lawyer in

 town on one condition. You can't see him anymore. - And the

 missing wife returned. - Hello, Alma. To understand the journey of Alma

 Hodge, you first need to know how it started. It began the

 day she wed Orson Hodge, a man she had tricked into marriage

 by getting pregnant. Alma was confident that as their family grew, Orson's

 feelings for her would grow as well. But then something went wrong,

 and the baby she had been counting on never came. So Alma

 found herself married to a man who seemed to despise her. Still,

 Alma hoped things would get better. Mama loves her baby. Does the

 baby love Mama? Until the day she discovered Orson was having an

 affair. And Alma realized the only way she'd ever get her husband

 to appreciate her was to leave him... immediately. [squawking] If you don't

 get back in your cage right now, I'm going to have to

 leave you behind! Please. [squawks] - Going somewhere? - I'm staying at

 a motel tonight. - Why? - I don't have time to discuss

 it. - I'm late for the bus. - All right. I'm going

 away because... ...I know you're having an affair. - Ah. I see.

 Aren't you even gonna deny it? On the contrary, I want to

 shout it from the rooftops. For the first time in my life,

 I'm actually in love. How could you say that to me? I'm

 your wife! We both know why we got married. And it had

 nothing to do with affection. So you don't care if I go?

 No. Wait! This isn't what's supposed to happen! You should be begging

 me to stay with you. I deserve to be happy, Alma. So

 do you. And we're clearly not gonna find that together. Orson, no!

 [Mary Alice] It was at that moment Alma realized it wasn't enough

 to leave her husband. He had to be punished. Yes, this was

 the journey of Alma Hodge. Bree Hodge? I'm Alma Hodge. I believe

 we have someone in common. And it wasn't over yet. [Mary Alice]

 There is a time of day all housewives look forward to. It

 occurs just after the chores have been completed and right before the

 children come home from school. It's a time for good friends to

 get together, have a cup of coffee, and exchange gossip about the

 other good friends who couldn't make it that day. Bree let Orson

 move back in. - You're kidding. When? - Yesterday. I'm so disappointed

 in her. Well, the police did arrest Mike. I know you think

 he's innocent, but you can understand - why Bree's feelings have changed.

 - Well, mine haven't. And I know something that Bree probably doesn't.

 When Orson was 17, he spent time in a mental institution. How

 did you find that out? I snuck into his office and rifled

 through his things. Of course you did. That doesn't prove he had

 anything to do with Monique's murder. No, but it's a piece of

 the puzzle. I mean, he did have an affair with her. And

 when you combine that with the fact that his first wife went

 missing... So you're Alma. Where have you been all this time? In

 Canada. My aunt lives there. Well, you should have told someone. People

 thought you were dead. Some even thought that Orson killed you. Well,

 that's sort of what I wanted them to think. That's why I

 left my bird behind and only took cash, so they couldn't -

 trace me through my credit cards. - So you deliberately framed Orson?

 I'm not saying it was my finest hour. But you have to

 understand, Orson hurt me very badly. - He cheated on me. -

 Yes, I know, with Monique Polier. And I thought if I disappeared,

 she'd get scared and leave him, like he left me. Isn't jealousy

 awful? - So why have you come back? - I found this

 fantastic therapist. He told me that by holding on to my anger,

 I was really hurting myself, which was hard to deny. I mean,

 hello, I'm here in Winnipeg with a deaf aunt and no credit.

 So I thought... it's time to make amends. Darling, Mrs. McLean canceled,

 so I'm free for lunch. Um, actually, we have a guest. [AIma]

 Hello, Orson. Oh, hello. So, what is it with you and redheads?

 [insect buzzing] I hope you don't mind me springing this picnic on

 you. I figured it'd be more fun than some restaurant. Are you

 kidding? What could be more romantic? - Back off, you son of

 a bitch! - [cell phone ringing] More wine? Yes, keep it coming.

 Hello? [Carlos] Hey, hey! Who's the dork? - Carlos? - What's with

 that cap? Extra, extra, read all about it! Where the hell are

 you? - What are you doing at Mike's house? - I live

 here. You live there? Since when? My car's been in the driveway

 for three weeks. Even you can't be that self-absorbed. Well, as you

 can see, I have more pleasant things to focus on. When are

 you gonna tell Jimmy Olsen you hate picnics? I'm gonna hang up

 now. So where were we? Your ex-husband moved in across the street?

 - What's that gonna be like? - [cell phone ringing] - Yeah?

 - Are you gonna kiss him? That's right, Carlos. We have had

 some problems with raccoons getting into the trash. So why don't you

 just put a lid on it? OK, they're here. Now listen, stand

 up, Kayla has been through a lot. So when she walks in

 the door I want you to make her feel welcome. Give her

 a hug and be really nice. I'm giving her my room. How

 much nicer do I have to be? Well, nicer than that, or

 she's gonna get all your toys too. [Tom] Hey, hey, hey, look

 who I found wandering around the airport. Hi, Kayla! We missed you!

 We're so glad you're here. OK, boys. Good. Yeah. OK, so give

 her some room. Hey, wow, look, are those presents for Kayla? -

 Yes, they are. - Hey, look at that. Preston gave you a

 harmonica. Isn't that cool? - Harriet the Spy. Sounds mysterious. - Thanks.

 - And what did you get her, Porter? - A video game.

 - But I get to play it whenever I want. - Porter!

 You know what? I got you something too. This is Nellie. My

 grandma gave her to me when I was little, and I was

 hoping you could take care of her for me. Thanks. Hey, why

 don't you take your stuff and go upstairs and get ready for

 lunch. I'll make some chili. - OK, Daddy. - OK, baby. Honey,

 that was so sweet to give her your doll. She didn't seem

 that knocked out by it. Well, just give her some time. She'll

 come around. - It's a tough adjustment. - OK. I must say,

 Bree, I don't know when I've tasted such moist pound cake. Sour

 cream. Ah. So whatever happened to my parrot? - I set it

 free. - Mm! Orson, they don't fare well in the wild. You

 should have sold her. For God's sake, Alma, who cares about the

 damn bird. You set me up! Why don't I wrap up a

 piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later? Do you

 have any idea what you put me through? - You almost ruined

 my life. - You've rebounded nicely. - Bree's lovely. - Don't change

 the subject. You put me through a lot too, Orson. But I

 forgave you. - Can't we just put this behind us? - And

 that's all you've come back for? - Closure? - Of course. What

 else? I'm out of lipstick. Can I borrow yours? Sure. - Cherry

 Berry? - Austin likes the way it tastes. Oh, I so did

 not need to know that. So, where're you going? Down to the

 jailhouse to talk to Mike. But didn't you tell Ian you wouldn't

 see him anymore? Yeah, but somebody's got to tell him about his

 new lawyer. The guy'll show up and he's gonna go, \"Who the

 hell is he?\" Ian gets that. [sighs] Besides, why would it be

 a big deal? Mike and I are over. I was just wondering,

 because, you know, you're putting on lipstick to go to a prison.

 Thank you for clearing things up. Oh, well, it was the least

 I could do. Orson, I'm truly sorry for the pain I've caused.

 And if there's anything else I can do... Actually, there is. I'd

 love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend. There

 are some friends that I'm just... ...dying for you to meet. Hey,

 how you doing? - You got me a lawyer? - Yeah. And

 he is fantastic. You cannot believe the scum he has gotten off.

 Not that you're scum. But if you were, you'd be sitting pretty.

 I'm paying you back every penny. Well, you know, we'll figure that

 out later. I can't believe I just listened to all that stuff

 Edie told me about you. Turns out you're the only one standing

 by me. You're a good friend, Susan. Um... Yeah, about that... It's

 Ian. He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex. Even

 an ex who doesn't remember dating you? I remember, and I guess

 that's enough for him. I'm sorry. Well, I can't say that I

 blame him. - You take care of yourself, Mike. - You too,

 Susan. Dinner's ready. Kayla, I made your favorite... tacos. - Here you

 go. - Where's my daddy? Oh, sorry, sweetheart, he's working late, trying

 to get the restaurant ready. Oh, lovely, Parker. Go wash your hands.

 Go on. - Kayla, where you going? - To watch TV. Oh,

 sweetie, we don't watch TV during dinner. But my show is on.

 Well, I'm sorry, those are the rules. My mommy let me. Well...

 Just this once. OK, OK, I know what you're thinking, but Kayla's

 going through a hard time right now. Come and sit down. Letting

 her watch TV is like me letting you eat ice cream when

 you're sick. But she's not sick. Well, that's true, but she's sad.

 I'm sad I can't watch TV. Eat your tacos. - Whoa, whoa,

 whoa! Sit your butts down. - It's not fair! I don't care.

 We have rules. - Well, she gets to. - She is special.

 Now, sit down. Come on. - Does she get dessert too? -

 Of course I do. [channels changing] What an amazing documentary. You know,

 I read the director shot over 400 hours of film. Really? I

 only counted half that. - I get it. You pick the next

 one. - OK. Look at you! Who knew you were such a

 romantic? Actually, I... I didn't send them. You didn't? So who's making

 me look bad? Uh... there's no signature. - I'm sorry. This is

 kind of awkward. - No, hey, I don't care who worships you

 from afar... ...as long as I get to do it up close.

 Oh. [chuckling] That's sweet that you're not jealous. Carlos would have hit

 the roof if some guy sent me... Would you excuse me a

 minute? - Nice try, Carlos. - Huh? Don't act innocent. You know

 you sent me these flowers. - Why would I get you flowers?

 - To sabotage my new relationship. With Picnic Boy? What do I

 care? You care. First you move across the street, and earlier today

 I catch you spying on me. I was not spying. I was

 mocking you. - You need to move on, Carlos. - I have

 moved on. You're the one talking to your ex in the middle

 of a date. - Is he that boring? - Bill is not

 boring. He is vibrant. Mmm. - And sexy. - And yet, here

 you are. [laughing] She threw your doll in the trash? No, first

 she ripped off its arms, stuffed it with chili, then she threw

 it in the trash. So, what did you do? Nothing. And this

 is after you let her watch TV during dinner? Well, I didn't

 know what else to do. I'm trying to win over a little

 girl who clearly doesn't want a new mother. Well, I guess giving

 her special treatment isn't gonna solve anything. - You know what might

 solve something? - Hm? If you were home once in a while.

 You're the one she listens to. I am trying to open up

 a restaurant. Our life savings is riding on this thing. - I

 know, I know. - You know what? I don't want you to

 be afraid to take a firm hand with Kayla. She's part of

 our family now. And you know what that means. Yeah. I should

 treat her as badly as I treat my own children. Exactly. [kissing]

 Sorry. Um... I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. That's cool.

 Can't blame me for trying, though. Austin, you know I want to.

 It's just... Hey, don't sweat it. If you're not ready, you're not

 ready. So he didn't pressure you at all? What a great guy.

 I know. I'm so lucky. Underneath all that bad-boy posturing, he's a

 real gentleman. Wow. You're not only a virgin, you think like one.

 Beat it, eavesdropper! No, wait. Um... What did you mean by that?

 Well, uh, guys need sex. All right? It's basic science. So, if

 he's not getting it from you, he'll end up getting it somewhere

 else. You're a moron. Not all guys pressure girls for sex. Yeah,

 gay guys don't. But Austin's not gay. Not even after three beers.

 Don't ask. So, what's your point? If a guy has to wait

 too long to see you naked, he'll end up seeing you as

 a friend. Again, science. Don't listen to him. You hold on to

 your virginity. If Austin won't wait, he doesn't deserve you. I just

 don't want to lose him. It's better than losing your self-respect. Take

 it from a girl who's known at school as \"Little Miss Van

 de Tramp.\" - I thought you made that up. - Only because

 it was nicer than the other names they were calling me. I

 really appreciate you donating this stuff. Anything for a good cause. Everyone

 at the shelter's gonna be so excited. To you and me, these

 are just a bunch of old clothes, but to a homeless woman...

 ...it's a chance for her to feel pretty again. You OK? -

 What? - I asked if you're OK. You seem kind of distracted.

 I am fine. Yes. I just remembered, today's my mother's birthday. Can

 we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter? Yeah.

 Detective Ridley? My name is Susan Mayer. And I'm calling to drop

 a dime on someone. That's the expression, right? Yes, ma'am. You've got

 the lingo down pat. Good. Uh... his name is Orson Hodge, and

 he had an affair with the woman that you think Mike Delfino

 killed. Monique Polier? Are you sure? Because Mr. Hodge saw her body

 in the morgue. - He acted like he didn't know her. -

 He does. So he's pretending he didn't. That's suspicious, right? Well... -

 [phone beeps] - Oh, can you hold on? - Hello? - Susan,

 hi, it's Bree. Bree! Uh... hi. Can you hold on a second?

 It's Orson's wife! - She can't know I called you. - How

 about you don't tell her? Right. Sorry. I'm new to this whole

 snitch thing. Hold on, OK? Bree, hi. Sorry about that. Damn telemarketer.

 So, what can I do for you? I just feel really awful

 about our fight, and I think it's time for an apology. Oh,

 Bree. I am so relieved. Would you join Orson and me for

 dinner tomorrow night? Oh. Uh... - Sure. - Good, I'll see you

 at 8:00. Bree, I just want you to know that, no matter

 what, your friendship means the world to me. Oh, Susan, you know

 I feel exactly the same... - [phone beeps to other line] -

 It's me again. You should also know that Orson spent a year

 in an asylum. [door opens] Hi. Can I help you? Hi, I

 received some flowers from your shop yesterday and the card didn't say

 who they were from. - Can you check? The name is Solis.

 - Sure, sure. Just give me a sec here. - Solis? -

 Yeah. Solis, Solis... Huh. This is odd. - The buyer asked to

 remain anonymous. - Really? Well, the flowers were so beautiful, I'd like

 to know who to thank. - Sorry. I have to honor their

 request. - Why? They're just flowers. They're not government secrets. - If

 you don't mind, I'm busy. - OK, wait, wait. Let me explain.

 What's to explain? A pretty girl gets flowers. Do you know how

 many girls never get flowers? I work in a flower shop. I've

 never gotten any freakin' flowers. So stop your whining about who sent

 them and just be glad he did. You're right. And I am

 so sorry for taking up so much of your time. And I'm

 sorry for doing this! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Hey!

 Hey! I'm gonna make it up to you, OK? Once I'm done,

 I'll send you flowers. Hey! You won't get away with this! -

 I know where you live! - Yeah, well, stop by. We'll hot

 tub. Hey, mister! Help! She locked me in here! Gabby? This is

 totally her fault. I mean, I simply asked her if Carlos sent

 me the flowers, and she refused to show me the order slip.

 Are you still hung up on that? - For God's sake. -

 Wait, wait! I need a couple more minutes. I need to know

 the truth! What truth is that? That you're still obsessed with your

 ex-husband? What? No, he's obsessed with me. You just imprisoned a florist

 to find out if he sent you roses. OK, I see what

 you mean. There. I'm done. Let's go. Actually... I think I'm done

 too. Oh. I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm probably not ready to date.

 Thanks. And just so you know, I am ready to date. All

 right, let's hit it. - Come on, Kayla. - I haven't finished

 my ice cream. Sorry, but we gotta go. I have a dinner

 party I have to get to. They got to finish their ice

 cream. Well, they, you know, wolfed it down like kids are supposed

 to. So hurry it up. Kayla, I'm not fooling around. We're going.

 Mm-hm. OK. Boys, go to the car. I'll be out in a

 minute. Go. Listen, sweetheart, I don't blame you for being angry. Your

 mom's gone, and you're stuck with me. But... ...the last thing she

 said to me was, \"Promise you'll take care of Kayla.\" And I

 am going to. But you're gonna have to help me, OK? We

 can leave when I'm done. OK. Let's go. [Ioud screaming] Hey, whoa,

 whoa, whoa, what the hell are you doing? - Stop! Stop screaming,

 stop! - Leave me alone! You're not my mommy! [sighing] Guys, how

 would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for

 a whole week? What are you guys doing here? [Kayla screaming] [Porter]

 Kayla, stop screaming, you're hurting my ears! [Parker] Just get in the

 car! [Preston] Come on, we're going home! [Porter] Get your seat belt

 on! Kids, they're always roughhousing. Why did you stop? Well, it's getting

 late. I got your blouse unbuttoned. That's usually when we call it

 a night. Do you want to call it a night? What, do

 you want to grab a pizza or something? I want to do

 what you want to do. Well, you know what I want to

 do. Well, OK. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. You can always

 spot the new guys by the way they pick through their food.

 So, what did you do when you thought no one was looking?

 - The cops say I killed a woman. - But you didn't,

 right? Actually, I have no idea. I got pretty banged up in

 an accident. The last two years are a blank. Well, that's a

 fresh approach. Not sure the jury's gonna swallow it. It's the truth.

 I believe you. OK, Mrs. McCluskey's downstairs and we will be right

 across the street if you need us. OK, Daddy. You know, I

 heard what happened with Lynette today. Hey, she's doing her best. Why

 are you being so hard on her? Because it's her fault my

 mommy died. No. No, no, honey, it's not. Mom only went to

 that store because Lynette was trying to steal me. OK, that is

 not true. Look, honey, it is way more complicated than that. I

 know you miss your mommy. And she loved you very much. But

 guess what? Lynette loves you too. That's why you got to give

 her a chance. Can you do that for me? OK. I'll be

 good. That's my girl. But I'm never gonna love her. And you

 can't make me. - Well, you've won. - What did I win?

 Bill and I split up. Can't say I'm surprised. He wasn't right

 for you. I know. So just admit you sent the flowers. I

 didn't. Carlos, just tell me. I won't be mad. I promise. Gabby,

 if I was gonna send you flowers, I wouldn't send you pink

 roses. I'd send you white orchids. Because I know they're your favorite.

 And if I wanted to cheer you up, sunflowers. And for the

 flu... blue irises. [sighs] I hate that you know me so well.

 And it took so long for that to happen. Now I have

 to start over again with somebody else. Yeah. That's what dating is

 for. I know, and it sucks. I mean, you saw me. I

 went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can! It

 was horrible! Well, if it makes you feel any better, I got

 dragged to the ballet the other night. So you are dating? That's

 why you've been lifting weights and jogging. Well, if you wanna bag

 the big game, you gotta work on the guns. [both chuckling] I'll

 give you this: You're gonna be a tough act to follow, Carlos.

 Back at ya, babe. [chuckles] I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,

 but I don't want to introduce you until all my guests are

 here. I don't mind. By the way, um, when my friends ask

 you what happened, and they will, I don't think it's necessary to

 go into all that unpleasantness about Orson and Monique. All they need

 to know is that you're back and we're on good terms. And

 Orson didn't kill me. And Orson didn't kill you. - [doorbell ringing]

 - [Bree giggling] OK, just one minute, that'll be Susan. Hi. I

 brought you a Bundt cake. - Don't worry, I didn't make it.

 - You didn't have to do that. I was really touched by

 your call. It was so big of you. Well, when you're wrong,

 you're wrong. Now that we're all assembled, I'd like to introduce the

 guest of honor. I hope you'll all be as delighted to meet

 her as I was. You can come in now. Everyone, this is

 Alma Hodge. Orson's first wife. Oh, about that apology, any time you're

 ready. So you've been in Canada this entire time? Well, my Aunt

 Agnes has a place in Winnipeg. I hadn't planned on staying so

 long, but I needed the time to find myself. Would've been nice

 if someone else found you. - There was a lot of drama

 around here. - Yes, I heard. People actually thought Orson had done

 away with me? Amazing, isn't it, where some people's minds will go?

 You gotta hand it to her. Just when you think Bree's thrown

 every conceivable theme party she hosts a \"shame on you for thinking

 my husband killed someone\" dinner. So Alma's alive. We don't know what

 went down between Orson and Monique. Susan, please. We look stupid enough

 for suspecting him. Just let it go. It may be a little

 late for that. Detective Ridley, can I help you? Yes, I'd like

 to speak to your husband. Oh, well, I'm afraid he's not here,

 but I will be happy to tell him that you came by.

 [Orson] Who is it, darling? Excuse us. Can't this wait? We're having

 a dinner party. - Hello, Dr. Hodge. - Detective Ridley. We need

 you to come with us. We have questions about that Jane Doe

 we showed you in the morgue. Why do you think I'd know

 anything about her? Well, you were having an affair with her when

 she died. And where did you hear that? Susan. I didn't know

 they were gonna come tonight. I'm happy to answer any questions that

 you might have. My apologies. Please, stay and enjoy the dessert. I

 don't believe this. You called the police? Obviously you weren't going to.

 They needed to know that dead woman was Orson's mistress. I told

 you that in confidence. Did you seriously think I could sit on

 information that would exonerate Mike? If you had seen his face in

 jail the other day... - The other day? You saw Mike? -

 Yeah. Just to tell him about the lawyer. - I know that

 Mike is innocent. - Right. Just like you knew she was dead.

 - I thought we had an agreement. - We do. - Can

 we talk about this later? - When? After your next conjugal visit?

 Ian, wait! Boy, when it comes to Mike, there's no one you

 won't betray. - Excuse me? - Hey, guys. - Please leave my

 house. - Bree! You heard me. Get out! Bree, I know you're

 angry, but for the sake of our friendship... Oh, make no mistake.

 Our friendship is over. [Lynette indistinctly whispering] [door closing] So Winnipeg... ...it

 must get pretty cold up there. I'm just getting my coat. Ian,

 please, I just lost one of my best friends. I can't lose

 you too. - You said you wouldn't see him again! - But

 you had to know that I would go one more time to

 explain everything. - Actually, no, I didn't. - Well, that's just crazy.

 Why are you acting like a crazy person? Because you've already left

 me once for this guy! Things are different now! I love you!

 You don't have to worry about that anymore. If we're gonna make

 this relationship work, you have to trust me. - Why are you

 smiling at me? - You just said that you love me. -

 Yeah. So? - Well, you've never said that before. - Yes, I

 have. - No, I would've remembered. I'm saying it now. I love

 you. Do you have a problem with that? - No, ma'am. -

 You can't kiss me now. - I'm yelling at you. - I'm

 listening. Well, don't think that you can get out of this, you

 know, by just... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, right there... Right

 there. [gasping] Look, I think we should stop doing this. I know

 it's my idea, but it just doesn't feel right anymore. So you

 slept with Julie. It's no big deal. It is to her, and

 I don't want to see her get hurt. Me either. So, let's

 just not tell her. [Edie] There's no place in Fairview that's more

 peaceful. All the floors are hardwood. There are brand-new appliances. And the

 gardens are... Well, they're beautiful. So, what do you think? I'll take

 it. Really? That's terrific. I'll draw up the papers in the morning.

 If you don't mind me asking, why were you so interested in

 this particular street? I've been moving around a lot in the last

 few months. And I need a place where I can really settle

 down. You know what I mean? I want to live in a

 place where children know how to behave. Where people still have some

 sense of moral value, and where friendships are good and strong and

 last forever. That's what I'm looking for. Then I think Wisteria Lane

 is the place for you. Good. More than anything, I just want

 to fit in. [Mary Alice] Oh, you will, Alma. You absolutely will."}
