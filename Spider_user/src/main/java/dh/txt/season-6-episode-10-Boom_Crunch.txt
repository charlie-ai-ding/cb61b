 ":"Desperate

 Housewives S06E10 Boom Crunch (VO+STFR&EN) Orson's blackmailing me to stay with him.

 To escape her marriage... Lamar Benjamin? You know my husband from the

 penitentiary. Bree arranged her own blackmail... - I don't want to fight

 anymore. - While a friendship... hit the rocks. You wanted to sue

 us! That proves that you are not my friend. Calm down. I'm

 not an idiot. I used a prepaid, they're not gonna find us.

 - I killed a man. - A desperate act... led to a

 revelation. - Would you like some juice, Danny? - My name's Tyler.

 The whole time I was with you, all I thought about was

 Susan. - And a revelation... - If you mean it, then please

 kill me. I don't care enough about you to kill you. -

 ... led to a desperate act. - I need an ambulance right

 away. I'm losing a lot of blood. Daphne Bicks was an unhappy

 woman. And no one knew this better than her husband. That's why

 he hired her to work with him. He thought it might cheer

 her up. But sadly, Jeff Bicks soon discovered that it would take

 a lot more than a job... This coffee's cold. ... to keep

 his wife from complaining. She complained from the moment they got up

 in the morning... Another sleepless night thanks to your snoring. ... till

 they were on their way home at the end of the day.

 You want to see if you can hit all the red lights?

 Things had gotten so bad, Jeff Bicks began to wonder when God

 would end his suffering. Luckily for Jeff, God had a plan. You're

 unbelievable! You're so cheap. It's friggin' Christmas, for God sake. I'm not

 buying you a new car. Tricia Reed's husband got her a new

 car. It isn't even a holiday. He bought it for her because

 she beat cancer. You beat cancer, I'll buy you a car. Don't

 beat it, I'll buy you two. - Why are we even together?

 - The hot sex. You're cheap, rude. You lack ambition. I should

 just dump your sorry ass. You want a gift? - How about

 a divorce? - Don't tempt me. I'm serious. I already got the

 name of a divorce attorney. You want a divorce? You got it!

 Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, and he's giving me my

 balls back! Correction... one of them. I get half of everything. -

 But not the business. I started that. - With my father's money.

 So I get half, and I'm selling it. Wait a minute. Let's

 talk about this. - Now you're scared? - You'd be that vindictive?

 Destroy the one thing I love out of spite? Hello?! Have we

 met? Of course I would. And I am not stopping there. Bank

 accounts, pension funds... I'm gonna ruin you. - What's the matter? -

 I can't breathe. Nice try, big faker. My chest hurts like hell.

 Take the controls. What? You gotta land the plane. What?! You piece

 of crap! You can't do this to me! And that is how

 the unhappy marriage of Jeff and Daphne Bicks ended... In a plane

 losing altitude right above a cul-de-sac... Is it just me, or is

 that plane flying really low? By the name of Wisteria Lane. I

 think it's gonna crash. The best Christmas ever... That's what the residents

 of Wisteria Lane were dreaming of as they prepared for their annual

 yuletide festival. So they hung up a banner... Brought out their candy

 canes... And put up Santa's workshop, as eager as children for the

 holiday to begin. Of course, some were more childish than others. Look

 at this mess. It's like Santa's colon. That's funny. Did you hear

 that? Hilarious. Almost as funny as when Orson said it last year.

 How about some Christmas music? Parker, you got that sound system fixed?

 Almost. Do we really want the kid working with electricity? He can't

 even get the newspaper on my porch. You're clumping. - What is

 going on with you two? - I don't want to get into

 it. Whatever it is, work it out. We are caroling at the

 festival on saturday, and we can't have two of our jingle belles

 fighting. If you need a replacement, I've been told that I have

 a dusky alto. No way! Girls only. We're the jinglebelles, not the

 jingle balls. Shouldn't you be out stealing the last can of who

 hash? You want to see me go all Grinch on your ass?

 To be honest, I'm not gonna be able to sing with Lynette

 after... after she what? Are you about to trash me? I have

 way too much class to trash you, no matter how much you

 deserve it. Merry Christmas to me. What did she do? She's suing

 Carlos. - You're suing him? - Because he fired me. - He

 fired her? - Because she lied about being pregnant. - You're pregnant?!

 - With twins. - You knew? - I told her to keep

 it quiet. - Congratulations. - Sure, take her side. She's not! Stop

 fighting. With all we've been through lately... Julie being attacked, Danny Bolen's

 overdose... We really need some Christmas spirit around here. Susan's right. This

 is the time we should come together and celebrate peace on earth

 and good will towards men and... Crap. Who's dead now? - What's

 going on? - Something's happened to Katherine. I was just there five

 minutes ago. - Was she okay? - She was really upset. I

 hope she didn't do something to herself. You're not gonna believe this,

 but the cops say that someone stabbed her right in the gut.

 What? Who would do that? You've got to be kidding me. Hey

 there. How you feeling? - A little hungry. - 'Cause they pumped

 your stomach. But if you want, Tyler, I can have them bring

 you some soup. Why did you just call me that? - You

 told me to, last night. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

 Twice. You were still a little groggy, but you said your name

 was Tyler. Maybe I was dreaming. My name's Danny. Can I see

 my mom? Please. Sorry. Not while you're under observation. I'll have someone

 bring you that soup. I don't get this. We gave you a

 check to cover the ambulance - and everything else. - I know.

 But we still need your insurance information, Mr. Bolen. - It's policy.

 - Like us not being able to see our kid? So you

 have two stupid policies. There could be some unforeseen expenses, tests we

 may have to run. If you don't have insurance, there are government

 programs. If you could just give me your information... - We don't

 need a handout. - We have cash. - Thank you, though. -

 Gayle. Can I speak with them? I know what's going on. What

 do you mean? I knew something was up the moment you moved

 onto the Lane. You never talk about your past. We're private people.

 Is there a law against that? Having no insurance, wanting to pay

 cash for everything, having a son who can't rember if his name

 is Danny or Tyler... Where you going with all this, Mona? You're

 in the witness protection program, aren't you? You are one sharp cookie.

 - How'd you figure it out? - Honestly? Once I noticed you

 were Italian, I just kinda went from there. No offense. None taken.

 I can't believe I'm right. So... What went down? You witness a

 hit? Did you rat on one of the five families? We can't

 talk about it. And neither can you, to anybody. - Of course

 not. - Because if you do say anything... We're gonna have to

 have you whacked. Any more news about Mike and Katherine? No. But

 I'm sure he'll be exonerated. Mike could never do something that awful.

 That's my Bree... always seeing the good in people. Forgive me for

 starting your day on a sour note, but I filed for divorce.

 Here are the papers. And if you try to stop me, your

 parole officer will see these. Consorting with a known felon is a

 parole violation. If you send me to jail for fraud, you're going

 with me. It's over, Orson. This must have been quite a project

 for you... Finding Lamar, setting up the camera. Sorry to put you

 through so much needless trouble. I would hardly say needless. Without these,

 you'd still have a gun to my head. Do you really think

 I would send you to jail? It's what you've been threatening. I

 was bluffing, Bree, right from the start. I could never hurt you

 that badly, no matter what. You didn't need these. You could've called

 my bluff and walked away anytime. The fact that you did believe

 me, that you thought I'd destroy you just out of spite, that

 alone should've told me it was over. I will pack after breakfast.

 For what it's worth, I'm sorry it had to end this way.

 Me, too. These scones you made are delicious. I'll miss them. Here's

 Katherine's room. You might hear some screams for help. Ignore them. Is

 that what you meant by, \"I'll behave calmly and rationally\"? That was

 just to get you to unlock the car door. You gotta be

 Katherine Mayfair's best friend, 'cause she could put Mike away - for

 a very long time. - I know. - Might help if you

 give her these. - Good idea. She pisses me off, I can

 crack the vase over her head. No, Dylan. The police have everything

 under control. There's no reason for you to fly out here. Honey,

 I've got a visitor. I gotta go. Talk to you later. Come

 in. What a sweet gift. I didn't even think I'd see you

 here. I was concerned about you, Katherine. A lot of people are.

 Actually, the one they should be concerned about is you. Why is

 that? Because the man you just married turned out to be a

 maniac. About that... We both know... That Mike didn't do this. Really?

 I've got seven stitches and a knife with Mike's fingerprints that say

 otherwise. It doesn't make... anysense. Why would Mike want to stab you?

 If you must know... I told him I was in love with

 someone else, and he flew into a rage. Will you stop lying?

 If you don't tell the truth soon, you are sending an innocent

 man to jail. You are taking a father away from his son.

 It's Mike's fault, not mine. Katherine, please! Even though I am so

 angry with him, when you think about it, it's really kind of

 flattering... To go this far to keep me from being with someone

 else. How did it go? I don't know anymore. I can't tell

 if she's crazy or just devious. A little of both. Tell me

 how I get the crazy part committed. Only a family member can

 commit somebody to an institution. Really? Excuse me. I was just with

 my friend Katherine in 607, and she was talking to her daughter,

 and she wanted me to follow up about something. Do you have

 that number? Dylan Mayfair? - Would you mind dialing that number? -

 Certainly. There you go. This is Dr. Brewster calling from Fairview General.

 I understand that you were just speaking with your mother. Right. I

 do feel, given her condition, it is important for you to come

 here if you can. Lovely. See you soon. That's devious. 50 cents

 off paper towels... That's a great coupon. - This is fun. -

 It sure is. And me doing my own roots is gonna be

 fun, and getting rid of cable. We're gonna be having so much

 fun around here. - Mommy? - Are we poor? Only financially. -

 Don't forget that one. - Ravioli in a can? I like poor

 food! - What'd they say? - I've attended classes for six weeks.

 They won't refund any of my tuition. Unbelievable. Is there a sign

 over us that says \"crap here\"? It'll be okay. I'm looking for

 a job, and in the meantime, we got enough money live on

 for the next... four months? So we'll run out right before the

 babies are born. Yes, but remember, kids don't miss what they never

 had. Like food, clothing, sober mother? I am so sorry. For what?

 For what I have done to this family. You have to drop

 out of school. Penny is clipping coupons. I have really screwed this

 up. We'll get some money if we win the lawsuit. Won't that

 be great? Living off the money we made suing our best friends.

 At least Gaby tried to apologize and stop this. Maybe it's your

 turn. Damn it! Whatever it is, I can explain. That was the

 chairman of my board. This Lynette thing is turning into a fiasco.

 That lawyer said you did everything by the book, that we were

 covered. It doesn't matter what he said. Bottom line is, it looks

 bad for global venture... Big corporation going after a pregnant woman. -

 What's gonna happen? - If this suit goes to trial... I'm done.

 And even if it doesn't, I might still lose my job. I've

 put everything into this company. I know I'm probably the last person

 you want to talk to. You got that right. It's done, Karl.

 Orson signed the papers. I know. I've never been happier. I absolutely

 want to see you, too. Meet me at the motel, and we'll

 find a way to celebrate. Till then, my darling. When you move

 on, you don't waste any time. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell

 you this morning, but I felt I'd hurt you enough for one

 day. Much better to parcel out the pain. Is it someone I

 know? Never mind. I can't handle that right now. Just tell me

 this... Have you told your friends you're seeing anyone? Of course not.

 Good. Please don't until I'm gone. I'm saying good-bye to everyone at

 the party tomorrow. I don't want it to turn into a pity

 fest for poor Orson. I won't go public with my new relationship

 until we're divorced. And I'll say we started seeing each other... After

 you and I separate. What a tasteful solution. You must write an

 etiquette book for adulterers. I don't blame you for being angry. And

 I give you my word, I will not let my affair be

 an embarrassment to you. So when the plane flies over the christmas

 party, I want it pulling a big-ass banner that reads, \"Will you

 marry me, Bree? Love, Karl.\" - Isn't that romantic? - Glorious. That'll

 be 600 bucks. I don't care. You can't put a price on

 love. He can. Our anniversary? $20 gift certificate to a rib joint.

 You didn't have to cook that night. So the gift was for

 both of us. Good luck, Mr. Mayer. I hope this Bree says

 yes... Almost as much as I wish I had said no. For

 what it's worth, i'm a divorce lawyer. For God sake! Jeff, look

 at the mess in here! Do you have a card? I have

 nothing to say to you. I know what your mother must have

 told you. It's what she told everyone. But it's not true. Do

 you really think I'm gonna take your word over hers? I am

 so worried about your mom. I am not just thinking about Mike.

 The hell you're not. Get over him. He's married to my mother.

 - What? - You know, it's bad enough that you make a

 scene at their wedding and you hound them night and day. And

 you stab her because you can't have him? Is that what she

 told you? I don't know why you're not locked up right now.

 You're crazy. We need to talk. I don't understand. For months, my

 mom has been telling me about her life with Mike... The gifts

 that he's given her and trips that they've planned. Your mom needs

 help. And so does Mike. What do you want me to do?

 Good news. Dr. Cheng says I can give your parents an early

 christmas present. You're released. Grab your stuff. I'm taking you home. -

 Thanks for the ride. - Happy to help. I can't imagine how

 tough it is for you guys to live this way. What way?

 Running all these years, always looking over your shoulder. Relax, Danny. Your

 parents told me about your situation. Well, actually, I figured it out.

 Your mom just filled in the details. Why would she do that?

 Frankly, I think she was glad to finally find someone she could

 be honest with. And that goes for you, too. If you ever

 need to talk, you can trust me. I hope so. Cause if

 you say anything, they're gonna throw my mom in jail. It doesn't

 work that way. Are you kidding? Ever since 9/11, the feds are

 hard-core on any terrorist stuff, even the old cases. If they find

 her, she's dead. What do you mean? I thought we were picking

 you up tomorrow. - Ma, I screwed up. - What are you

 talking about? I told Mona everything. Thanks for giving Danny a ride.

 I am so sorry he dragged you into our family drama. I

 mean, you know better than anyone what a bad head space he's

 in right now. He's so angry at me and his dad, he

 just wants to hurt us, which would explain the wild story he

 just told you. So... We good? I hate my job. All I

 do is deal with disturbed people, wipe their drool, strap them down.

 I hate it. Well... - Maybe you should get a different job.

 - I wanted to, but they say you should have a year's

 worth of living expenses. And I didn't know where I'd get the

 money. $67,000. That's what I've needed to cover my mortgage, my car,

 everything for a year. 67 grand. If you could do that for

 me, then we'd all be free. What are you doing here? I

 asked you not to come. I had to. You were hurt. Have

 you been to the house? I'm so sorry Mike wasn't there to

 welcome you. He's away on business. No, he's in jail. You told

 the police he stabbed you. I... never said that. I told you...

 Susan attacked me. Then why did the police arrest Mike? I don't

 know. Maybe he confessed to protect her. Susan's his wife. That's ridiculous.

 Who told you that? Susan? They let me speak with him. Mom,

 Mike is in jail, and that's not right if he didn't do

 anything. Did you stab yourself? Mom, did you? I asked you not

 to come. You don't understand. Susan trapped him, filled his head with

 lies. This is gonna save him. He knows why I did it.

 He wants this. What is she doing here? I wanna help you,

 Katherine. I have to get to Mike. He's expecting me. I can

 fix it. You'll see! I have to go! We need a little

 help here. Everything's gonna be wonderful! I have to get to Mike!

 We need some help here! - Get your hands off of me!

 - Mrs. Mayfair, please! Please, Mrs. Mayfair, we're trying to help you.

 It's okay. Honey, everything's gonna be okay. I asked you not to

 come. Wait up. I wanna go with you. Can't I have one

 moment of peace? Our therapist said we need to do more stuff

 together. I know. That's why I don't go to the therapist with

 you. Would it kill you to spend some time with the woman

 you love? I don't know. Would you be upset if I brought

 her? As long as she doesn't deflate in the plane. Gaby, please

 talk to me. I feel just awful. You know why? Because you

 are awful. You're an awful person. - You have every right to

 be mad at me. - Thanks, Lynette, and you have every right

 to go to hell. Stop talking to me! Thank you, all, for

 coming out to our annual holiday festival. And, as it's been our

 tradition these last 12 years, please welcome back the Jingle Belles. All

 right, ladies. Sparkle! I can't believe they wouldn't let you sing with

 them. It's their group. They can do whatever they want. Whores. Do

 you mind? You're blocking me with yourbig fat head. I thought we

 weren't talking. You know, I was trying to apologize. It's too late.

 Carlos is probably gonna lose his job over this stuff - you're

 putting him through. - Gee, I wonder what that feels like. By

 the way, because your husband canned me, Tom had to quit school.

 The 45-year-old freshman has to drop out? Maybe he'll get a paper

 route. Move! Fine. You want to be a jerk? Gaby give me

 my hat back. Gaby, give me my hat back! Give that back

 to me! Give me my hat back! - Gaby, give it back!

 - All is calm! All is calm! - She's the one who

 started it! - She's being a bitch. I don't remember the word

 \"bitch\" being in the song. It's always been there. We are going

 to take a little... break mid-song, and we will be right back.

 Have a little punch. I realize you two are having a problem...

 a giant problem. And now half of Fairview does, too. So, A,

 you're fired, and B, work it out. Gaby, I'm sorry about everything,

 but you have no idea what losing my job has done to

 my family. Why don't you slip your cankles into my shoes and

 walk a mile? You just don't care about anyone but yourself. No,

 I do. I care about my friends. Sorry you are no longer

 a part of that group. I'm in. It's a christmas miracle! We

 can't just let some stupid housewife shake us down for 67 grand.

 What do you want from me? We gotta try to make this

 go away. We got the emergency 10 grand, but that is a

 long way from $67,000. Maybe this'll get us closer. You little... Now

 do be careful, you little munchkins. Excuse me. - What are you

 doing here? - I just thought I'd come by and - give

 you an early christmas present. - Stop it! We can't be seen

 together. What's the big deal? Susan knows. The cat's out of the

 bag. Orson doesn't know. - You didn't tell him? - About the

 affair, yes. But he has no idea it's you. Now, Karl, please

 go. I promised him there'd be no scenes today. Just came by

 to check on the decorations. - Great job, Mrs. Hodge. - Save

 it, Karl. I'm not an idiot. You obviously heard Bree and I

 are divorcing, and vulture that you are, you've swooped in to make

 a buck by representing Bree. - A man's gotta eat. - Perhaps.

 But soliciting business at a christmas party? That's tacky, even for you,

 Karl. If this is who you want representing you, that's your choice.

 But frankly, I thought you hahigher standards. Remind me not to let

 him make a toast at our wedding. It's not funny, Karl. Now

 just go before he figures it out. Yeah, about that... You know

 that christmas present I mentioned? Don't you dare give me a present

 in front of all these people! I'm not sure I can stop

 it. It's being delivered... by air. What did you do? Just let

 me make one quick call. How do you turn this thing on?

 Somebody help! I don't know how to fly! I released the banner.

 Now what? Look for a place to land... A field, a large

 parking lot. All I see are neighborhoods. Negative. Street landing is too

 dangerous. That's all there is! What do you want from me?! Okay,

 calm down. Keep her steady. Jeff, it's Karl. Are you there? Come

 on, pick up. If you get this message, and please, please get

 this message... you need to abort. Do not, repeat, do not fly

 over Wisteria park with that banner. - What banner? - Call me.

 What banner? You know how you're always saying to me I should

 be more romantic? Well, I thought, what if I hire a plane

 to fly over Bree's street carrying a banner with a heartfelt personal

 message? When you put a message on a banner, it ceases to

 be personal. What does it say? Something like... \"Bree, will you marry

 me? Love Karl.\" I was trying to be romantic. When we began

 this affair, we agreed to be discreet. Do you know what discreet

 means? No skywriting! Poor Orson! Do you know how humiliated he'll be?

 - I have to warn him. - Bree, wait. I made this

 mess. I'll deal with it. Orson deserves the truth, and he should

 hear it from me, not a banner. You got a minute? I

 need to talk to you. What, here? Can't it wait? Not really.

 If this is about the settlement, I told Bree there's very little

 I want. That's not the problem. It's what I want... You're too

 late. She has a boyfriend. You? If I were a betting man,

 I've lost a bundle on this, too. So... wait... You're having sex

 with my wife? The point is, we don't wanna make this any

 harder for you than it has to be. I just wanted to

 warn you that in a few minutes... Okay, you're the husband. I'll

 give you that one. I'm trying to spare your feelings, which is

 why... That's it. The hell with your feelings. I am proposing to

 Bree today with an airplane banner. And trust me, that will be

 the highlight of your day! One moment, please. Have you been to

 see Santa yet? You want me to take you? Come on. I

 will take you to see Santa. We're gonna do this right here?

 Just like that? This seems like a pretty small envelope for such

 a big secret. It's 10 grand. And my wedding ring. It was

 my grandmother's. - It's all we have right now. - But... I

 gave notice at the hospital. I can't go back there. That's the

 best we can do. I have a job at Bree's. I could

 pay the rest as I make it. Sure, until you disappear into

 thin air. Just because I have lawn gnomes doesn't mean I'm stupid.

 You don't know the whole story. I know you killed someone and

 walked away scot-free. Scot-free? Does this look scot-free? I don't think Danny

 told you the whole story, but maybe you should hear it. 4

 miles I ran today, and now I'm drinking eggnog. It's like mayonnaise

 with rum in it. Excuse me. What are you doing?! Stop it!

 This is ridiculous! Please! For God sakes, stop it! And that was

 18 years ago and we've been looking over our shoulders ever since.

 That sounds like a very reasonable story... So reasonable that I don't

 understand why you couldn't just call the police right now and explain

 it to them. Someone's dead. You know I can't do that. What

 I know is you've got till tomorrow to come up with the

 rest of the money, or I go to the police. Capisce? Is

 it just me, or is that plane flying reallylow? Can we talk

 about this? Don't do this. You are screwing with people's lives here.

 This could blow up in your face. $67,000 by tomorrow or I

 call the police. House. House. House! We're not done here. You can

 run, but you can't hide! Run! The best christmas ever... That's what

 everyone had wanted. But something went wrong... Horribly wrong. For those who

 survived, it would be a day they would try to forget. For
