 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives: My husband died thinking I murdered him. Bree put

 the past behind her. Keep me as your lawyer, your wife's off-limits.

 - He's my lawyer. - Carlos gambled with his future... How much

 money do you need to get to Utah? ...Susan interfered with a

 family reunion. George Williams had never been lucky in love. It seemed

 that the women he'd dated always invented reasons not to consummate their

 relationship. I'm afraid we'd wake my roommate. I have to get up

 really early for work. I'm... saving myself... for... marriage. Sadly for George,

 it was one unoriginal excuse after another. But since he'd started seeing

 Bree Van De Kamp, George couldn't help but feel... Hi. The kids

 are gone. We have the house all to ourselves tonight. ...his luck

 was about to change. I thought the duck turned out well. The

 sauce was a little bit thick, but judging by how many helpings

 you had, I think I got away with it. - What are

 you thinking about? - Your hair. Would you mind if I? No.

 Go ahead. That better? That was nice. It's OK that I'm doing

 this, right? I thought we were gonna let the duck digest a

 bit, but... ...what the heck. - What's wrong? - I don't know.

 I felt something weird. My tongue extends farther than most. I should

 have warned you. It wasn't your kiss. I felt something weird on

 my neck. - What are you doing? - I don't know. I'm

 starting to itch. What is it? You've got a huge rash. It's

 starting to spread to my face. Are you allergic to something you

 ate? I don't think so. I've made duck I'orange a thousand times.

 Something is causing that rash. Bree, Bree, please don't. I'm sorry, George,

 but you have to go. But the kids are away. I was

 sort of hoping we could make love tonight. How are we going

 to do that, George? You have just given me hives. Though painful

 to hear, George had to admit, at least this excuse was original.

 It's a fact that little girls dream of big white weddings. Of

 course, the exact same thing can be said for big girls, some

 of whom can get incredibly anxious waiting for the boys in their

 lives to make those dreams come true. Watch it, Susie. Mom, why

 don't you just go see a dressmaker. Wait, I have the perfect

 idea. You get in the dress, and I'll pin it. - We

 wear the same size. - Since when? Since forever. You have to

 leave, though. You can't stay. You can't see Susie in a wedding

 dress, not until your big day. - Mom! - No, it's not

 a problem. - I can see her in it. - You can?

 You can? You wanna pick out your own wedding dress when we

 get married, right? That sounds like a proposal. Did it? Yeah, it

 did. What do you know? Are you planning to pop the question?

 Well, if she knows it's coming, the question won't really pop, now,

 will it? He's right, Mom. Oh, I want it to be just

 like you do. On your own terms and you get down on

 one knee - and the whole production. - That's the plan. Then

 I can wait. I can wait. I'm a good waiter. Good. Just

 wondering if there's a ballpark of how long I will have to

 wait. A week? A month? After lunch? - You're not waiting for

 the pop. - Right, right. I 'm sorry. Yay! Oh, Mom! So

 the hives occurred right after you kissed George? Yes. It was the

 strangest thing. And so inconvenient. To be honest, I think we were

 about to make love for the first time. Bree, have you considered

 the idea that your subconscious mind was trying to sabotage your evening

 with George? Actually, I have not considered that because that's... idiotic. You

 don't think being with George made you feel a bit guilty? Why

 should I feel guilty? You felt you were about to commit adultery.

 Dr Goldfine, Rex is dead. You can't cheat on a corpse. Well,

 maybe that's not how you really feel, deep down. Oh, so... You

 think I'm crazy? You say you got a case of hives for

 no reason. I think there is a reason, and it's probably a

 psychosomatic one. You can think what you want. To be honest, I

 don't believe in the subconscious. Every time you've said \"Rex\" in this

 session, you stroked the place where your wedding ring used to be.

 Why did you do that? Let's talk about Monday. We are re-pitching

 to the Kamarov people. - Lynette, you'll be on point. - Great.

 Great. No problem. And can you do me a favour and maybe

 not wear the green suit? I wasn't planning to, but... why? The

 fabric. It just has this quality to it. Like you could, I

 don't know, wipe it clean with a damp cloth. I'll just wear

 a different suit then. Great. Like what, you think? Another suit. I

 have other suits. And if by other suits you mean the grey

 one, then of course you do. No, actually, I have quite a

 few others. The blue one, and... What's wrong with the blue suit?

 Stu, would you like to tell Lynette what's wrong with the blue

 suit? - No, that's cool. - Stu. Come on, do the thing.

 The thing you did at lunch. \"Look at me, I'm Lynette! Oh,

 I've got food stains everywhere.\" All right, so if I get my

 blue suit dry-cleaned, will that be acceptable to everyone? The pants also

 have a split seam in the back. Excuse me. Hello, David. What

 the hell is this? I thought I told you to dress maternal?

 Yes, you did. And I considered it for about a second. What

 happened? David, I know you're the lawyer and all, but trust me,

 it's never a smart strategy to cover this up. We've got 40

 minutes before the hearing. Let's go home and get changed. - What?

 - Want to get your husband out of jail? Dress like a

 pregnant, suffering wife, not the cover of Vogue. - David. - Louis,

 what are you doing here? I need a favour. If this has

 to do with my client's restraining order, answer's the same. You don't

 understand. I love Crystal. Yeah, we all love the pretty ladies at

 the Stop 'N Shop. But now you've gotta love her from 50

 yards away. You turned her against me. If it wasn't for you,

 we'd be together! Louis, Crystal hired me to keep you away from

 her. She doesn't want to see you. Yeah? Then why did she

 ask for my phone number? She's a cashier. You paid by check.

 It doesn't make you special. Don't walk away from me! We're having

 a conversation! Louis, this is your problem! You're creepy. Nobody likes you.

 What you call a conversation, the rest of us call harassment. You

 want a friend, get a hamster. David! - Run! - Call the

 police! Stay there! That's right, you'd better run! I'm gonna get bullets

 for this thing and come after you! Freeze! Hey, everything's cool. Are

 you OK? Weeds are a common annoyance of life in suburbia. And

 no matter how hard we try to get rid of them, they

 always tend to crop back up. Are you seeing this? I don't

 believe it. I mean, he's so brazen. He's mowing the lawn like

 nothing happened. What should we do? Should we call the police? Well,

 Susan did say that he murdered Mrs Huber. So my vote would

 be yes. Oh, my God. Susan's home. Has she seen Paul yet?

 I think so. Hello, Susan. Oh, my God. Paul... Need some help

 with those bags? Why... are you doing here? This is where I

 live. I came home to find my son. Here you go. -

 Don't come near me. - I'm giving back your pie filling. I

 don't want it! - Come on. Just take it. - No! Stop!

 Put that pie filling down. Slowly. - I'm calling 911. - You

 don't want to. Oh, I think I do. You're a cold-blooded murderer!

 How can you believe that? We've been neighbours for years. - Ladies.

 Good to see you. - Paul, we've called the police. You didn't

 really need to do that. We know what you did to Mrs

 Huber. Wonderful. I see you've all turned into Susan while I've been

 gone. Oh, thank God, they're here. Hey, hey. What's going on? Oh,

 Mayer's convinced that Paul Young murdered Martha Huber. Oh, my God! I

 live right behind him. I know. I gave him my house keys

 to feed my cat. I win. I made out with him. Here

 you go. There's no warrant here for a Paul Young. Why don't

 you ask Mike? He overheard everything, right? - Who's Mike? - He's

 my boyfriend. And he told me that Paul confessed everything to him.

 Mike has Martha's journals, which clearly prove that Paul had a motive.

 - All right. Where do I find this Mike? - He's... Follow

 me. You mind if I stay here? I've got a lot of

 raking to do. Let's go. There they go! Hey. What's going on?

 Mike, Paul Young is back. Look! Your girlfriend said Mr Young confessed

 a murder to you? No. No, not to me. I don't suppose

 you have a journal that belonged to a Martha Huber? No. I

 hardly knew her. Besides, you ever known a woman who'd loan out

 her diary? Mike, what are you doing? I'm sorry, Susan, I don't

 know what you're talking about. But I've got a job to get

 to. Anything else? No, that pretty much covers it. Well, someone might

 as well say it. Susan, what the hell have you been smoking?

 OK. Wow! Nice. Oh, my God. OK, don't be distracted by that.

 Look at me. Here I am tomorrow making my presentation. You see?

 You see how it moves with me? That's where the magic is.

 Nine hundred dollars? This one was the most expensive. The other ones

 aren't as nice. But look, look, look! Look at me. Look at

 me. Watch. I don't walk in it, I glide. Oh, my... You

 know what? There's got to be, like, $3000 worth of clothes here!

 Yeah, well, I haven't bought a new suit in six years. When

 I was working, you don't think I would've loved to have a

 designer suit? I wore wash-and-wear so we live in a nice neighbourhood,

 so we could take the kids on vacation every summer. I made

 sacrifices. I'm willing to make sacrifices. Great. Well, let's start here because

 this should cover a math tutor for Parker. - Whoa. Hold on

 a sec... - Six months of preschool for Penny. You're being ridiculous.

 Know what? The twins are gonna need braces. That ought to make

 a dent. Oh, no. Come on, Tom. Not this one. Strip. You

 saw the walk, right? You wanna see the walk again? I'll tutor

 Parker myself. Honey, that'd be great. You also gonna take up home

 dentistry? Fine. I'll take them back. Could you step out for a

 minute? I want to be alone with it for a little while.

 Hi, it's Bree. Hi. I was thinking about calling you. I just

 got some new antihistamines in at the store. I think they're gonna

 help with your rash. Well, great. How would you feel about the

 two of us checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow? What? I'd like

 that very much. I will let you make all the arrangements. Something

 out of town would be nice. Good night. Yes. - We need

 to talk. - Where did you come from? I'm sorry. I've been

 waiting. I'm upset because everybody thinks I'm crazy. - Can I get

 out of the truck first? - Yes, definitely. I understand why you

 wouldn't want the cops to know you kidnapped Paul. - I mean,

 that definitely looks bad. - Since I was on probation. Well, right.

 I mean, there's that. - And in possession of a gun. -

 Well, OK... Which I held to his head. So I violated my

 probation, committed a felony and coerced a confession. If the cops found

 out about that, I'd be looking at ten to 15 years. Why

 don't you want them to know about Martha's journal? She says there

 that she was blackmailing Paul's wife! She also says right in there

 that she was blackmailing you for burning down Edie's house. Oh. I

 forgot about that. I just can't believe it. I mean, there he

 is, a murderer, just living right on our street. There's nothing we

 can do because you're a felon, and I burned down that house.

 It's unfair. I want Paul Young gone as badly as you do.

 And he will be. But I also want to find Zach. And

 I think once Zach finds out Paul's here, I've got a feeling

 he'll be back. Well, that's comforting to know there's a silver lining.

 Dr Raiboff to Paediatrics. Dr Laurie Raiboff to Paediatrics. Hi. What are

 you doing here? Well, you protected me from a hail of gunfire,

 so I thought I'd stop by and give you a card. You're

 my first visitor. What do you mean? You've been here two days.

 My office sent me flowers. \"Dear David, who knew you could actually

 bleed? Sincerely, your stunned co-workers.\" Yeah, well, I'm a lawyer who got

 shot. Everybody's cracking wise. You're not gonna eat? I can't really cut

 yet. Well, I'm not gonna let you starve to death. Besides, you're

 gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail. You

 know, when I was waiting for the ambulance the other day, I

 seriously thought I was gonna die. I was scared. Of course you

 were. Thanks. - For what? - For not making any jokes. Sure.

 Now, open up. - Here. - Thank you. Good to see you.

 Just follow this hallway, straight down there, and make yourselves comfortable. For

 the good of their family, Lynette had made a promise to her

 husband... ...and within ten days from the date of purchase, she intended

 to keep it. - That's a fantastic suit. - Oh, thanks. I'm

 flattered, really. Who knew that you cared so much about what I

 think? I don't follow you. Well, I make a few innocent comments,

 and you go out and buy yourself a gorgeous new suit. Dance,

 puppet, dance! Actually, this was already in my closet. I just forgot

 about it. Forgot? You forgot that you had that suit? Good morning.

 Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo. Is everyone taken care of in terms of

 coffee and whatever else they may like? Great. Well, then let's get

 started. I will show you how Kamarov Vodka can expand its customer

 mindshare, while still holding the line on marketing costs. It's something we

 here at Parcher & Murphy like to call \"persuasive engineering\". Lynette. Just

 hold on one second. You have a... They put the price tags

 on the skirts these days too. Just so you know. Look at

 that everybody. Lynette just bought herself a beautiful, brand-new suit. Doesn't she

 look great? - Go on. - OK. You may be seated. Good

 to see you back on your feet, Mr Bradley. Whenever you're ready.

 Thank you, Your Honour. The defence moves to dismiss this case immediately

 on the grounds that the defendant... Are you all right, Mr Bradley?

 I'm sorry, Your Honour, I can't... I just can't. Mr Bradley, do

 you need a recess? What the hell's going on? - David, where

 are you going? - I'm sorry. I quit. You can't quit in

 the middle of a hearing. I'd love to get your idiot husband

 out of jail, but I can't do it. I'm sorry. - Why

 not? - Because I'm in love with you. What? The other day,

 I started to feel something. Maybe it was there all along. When

 I look into your eyes, I know you feel it too. We

 belong together. OK. Yeah. David. If you don't get back in there,

 I will go get a gun and shoot you myself. I can't.

 I'm sorry. Come in! We need to talk. Paul! You can't just

 waltz into people's houses. Susan, you told me to come in. Cos

 I assumed you were someone I would let in. What do you

 want? I was looking through my mail, and I found this. I

 was surprised to discover that you were looking for my son. You

 didn't find anything out about where Zach might be? No. No, I

 didn't. Sorry, I can't help you out. I'm asking because, if you

 remember, Zach hid here in this house before. Now I learn you've

 been searching for him. Well, he's not here. Well, maybe we should

 double-check. But he's not here! I swear! What are you grabbing for?

 A knife. I just want to slice some tomatoes. I don't know

 how I know this, but I think that he's in Utah. He

 took a bus to Bountiful. You have family there, right? OK, I

 gave him the bus fare. You might want to be careful with

 that. You seem a little jittery. Look, I know the timing is

 bad... - Pretty bad. - I feel terrible. How was I supposed

 to know he would take a bullet and realize he's in love

 with me? OK, look, I know I pushed you into hiring that

 creep. But I promise I will do anything I can to fix

 this. All right. Go have sex with Bradley. - What? - That's

 what you want me to say. God, you guys are good. I

 mean, you set me up perfectly. David and I planned this so

 we could sleep together? The guy tells me he wants to get

 into your pants, quits a week before my trial, and now you

 can't wait to do anything to get him back. Yeah. - I'd

 like to go back to jail now. - How dare you think

 that of me? I have been nothing but faithful to you! -

 Since you've been in here. - Save it. I know when I've

 been outfoxed. Please don't pretend that you're doing this for me. -

 I'd rather rot in here. - You know what? A lesser woman

 would let you. But I'm not gonna do that, give you the

 satisfaction. You better start packing your shanks or whatever you make here

 because you're coming home with me. I don't have any shanks. Good

 afternoon. Checking in? Yes. Reservation's under the name of Williams. George Williams.

 - Let me get your paperwork. - What do you want to

 do first? I don't know. I thought maybe we could go antiquing.

 I hear you have some lovely museums nearby. Do you have any

 brochures? Right over there, Mrs Williams. Oh, she's not my wife. I'm

 so sorry. So I hear they have a terrific farmers' market nearby.

 We should pick up some nectarines. - George... I can't. - What?

 - I can't stay in a hotel room with you. - Why

 not? I am starting to get that rash again. - I brought

 the antihistamines. - It's not gonna help. George, clearly this is psychosomatic.

 We need to go home. Bree, we just drove three hours to

 get here. I know, and you have every right to be mad.

 But, George, I am really starting to itch. - Is there a

 problem? - No. There's no problem. Everything is fine. OK. OK. OK.

 OK. - I'll get you your own room. - George... No. We

 can still have a nice weekend. We'll shift the focus to... antiquing.

 Please. Clearly you didn't come here to shop. I came to spend

 time with you. Time that does not need to be spent in

 a bed. Really? You mean that? You wouldn't mind? - No. -

 You know what, George? We're gonna have a great time because there's

 tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex. You

 betcha. While I take care of this, why don't you get those

 brochures? - OK. - OK. George, you won't believe it. I just

 stopped itching. How about that? - Nice suit. - Just hear me

 out. - I was gonna take it back, I swear. - But?

 But I started thinking about it. Know what? I'll be damned if

 I'm gonna pitch to a room full of people who are all

 wearing Armani and Vera Wang while I'm standing there with breast milk

 crusted on my lapel. - Lynette... - You know what else? I

 kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit. Lynette, it is

 a suit. Why are you so obsessed with it? You can't explain

 obsession, Tom. It just... is. No, we are parents. We can't afford

 the luxury of obsessions. See, that's where I think we have been

 making a terrible, terrible mistake. What is this? Sometimes we just need

 to get something that makes us happy. I know that sounds selfish,

 but I've been thinking. It might make us better people, and maybe

 even better parents. No. No, Lynette, no. This is wrong. Carbon fibre

 shafts. Wow. I feel like a better parent already. Oh, yeah. So

 I was talking to one of the bellmen, and he said there's

 a place not far where we could go horseback riding. Doesn't that

 sound like fun? George? What? What? I'm sorry. I was saying, I

 think we should go horseback riding. Oh, sure. That'd be great. -

 What's wrong? - Nothing. I just don't think that we should risk

 you getting another rash. I'm not gonna get a rash just by

 holding your hand. You never know. Well, OK. Hey. I brought those

 antihistamines with me. Maybe you should take a couple. Just to see

 if it works. Oh, well, I'm drinking wine. I don't think you're

 supposed to mix pills with alcohol. That's for people who are about

 to use heavy machinery. You don't plan on operating a forklift tonight,

 do you? Well, you are the pharmacist. If you think it's OK.

 I do. - Oh, George, I can't feel my legs. - I

 know, sweetheart. Don't worry. I'm gonna take you to your room and

 get you into bed. - Is she going to be OK? -

 Yes. She's just had a little too much wine. I don't think

 it was the wine, George. I think it was the antihistamines. She

 doesn't know what she's... We're good. Thank you. Oh, no, no, no,

 no, no. I'll get those. You just relax. I love you very

 much, Bree. You know that, right? I know. And I want, more

 than anything, for you to love me back. Do you understand what

 I'm saying? Bree? Hey there. How are you feeling? Oh, OK. Have

 you been sitting there all this time? I wanted to make sure

 you were OK. So I stayed and watched you sleep. Did I

 do anything embarrassing? Sometimes I snore. No. No, you slept like an

 angel. In fact, you were so beautiful and peaceful I actually started

 to feel guilty. Guilty? Well, you know, because I told you to

 take those pills. That chair looks so uncomfortable. Why didn't you sleep

 next to me? You've made it clear that you don't want me

 in your bed. George... I know what you want from me. And

 I... I thought I wanted the same thing, but I keep getting

 those rashes because... ...I still feel married. Makes sense, I guess. Can't

 you just be patient? Can't you wait just a little bit longer?

 I've already waited my whole life for you. And I can wait

 a little more. But let's be honest. There's no guarantee that you'll

 ever be ready. And there's only so much rejection I can take.

 So... I'll do my best. But don't be surprised if one of

 these days you wake up, and I'm not here. Well, I should

 get back to my room and try to get a little sleep.

 The antique stores open at ten. George, wait! Please don't go. Stay

 here with me. But what if you get another rash? Well, I'll

 just have to get over it, won't I? Gabrielle? I got your

 call... Wow. This mean what I think it means? There are some

 ground rules first. I'm not leaving my husband. Carlos is looking at

 eight years in jail because of my lapse of judgment with the

 gardener. I can't let him rot in there. I'd be filled with

 guilt. You could get him out and divorce him. Not an option.

 I'm Catholic. Hence the guilt. So, what are our options? This. Us.

 Stolen moments. Seeing each other whenever we can. Carlos never needs to

 know. No. I thought this was what you wanted. I want all

 of you. All or nothing. Then it's nothing. So, you won't get

 a divorce, but you'll have an affair? I said I was Catholic,

 not a fanatic. You know, David, you could tell me to stop.

 Just tell me to stop and I will. Or you can have

 me right now... on my terms. All right. - What are you

 doing? - Making my point. You don't love me! - Yes, I

 do. - No. You just agreed to an affair, a cheap, illicit

 affair with the woman you love? Carlos would never share me. He's

 looking at eight years in prison because the thought of it sent

 him into a violent rage. That is love. This is... this is

 just lust! Mixed with post-traumatic stress. I will see you in court

 tomorrow at 10am. Don't be late, or else I'll have you disbarred

 for sexual harassment. I'd take it easy with that snail poison. It's

 hell on your agapanthus. Thanks. I'll keep that in mind. Is that

 why you stopped by? Share a few gardening tips? Nobody wants you

 here, Paul. Especially me. I'm just a father looking for his son.

 Oh, I know what you are. First your girlfriend tries to run

 me off with some crazy story about sending Zach to Utah. Now

 you're here trying to scare me away. So much for \"love thy

 neighbour\". Anyway, thanks for the advice. About my agapanthus, I mean. I'll

 make sure I send you some. What did Susan tell you? Oh,

 you look beautiful! Oh, you should really consider wearing this when you

 marry Mike. We could make it a tradition. Why don't we both

 stop getting divorced? That could be a nice family tradition. - Hey!

 - I need to ask you something important. Oh, my God! Oh,

 this is it! Oh, let me get my camera! Oh, no, Mom,

 stop. What is it? Did you give Zach money to go to

 Utah? What? Yes or no. He was talking so much about Julie.

 I tried to get him to come home with me... To you!

 But he just kept going on and on about her, and I

 got scared... Yes or no. Yes. Mike! Mike, I didn't do it

 to hurt you. You've got to believe me. I should have told

 you right away, I know that. But you know now. So can

 we please talk about it? - No. - Mike, stop! Susan, you

 said you wanted to help me, and I believed you. That's it.

 We're done. No, no, no! I screwed up, OK? I want to

 fix it! Please let me fix it! Tell me how to fix

 it! Mike, I love you. Please, no. Please. Please. No, Mike! Mike,

 please! Come back! Come back! Yes, every little girl dreams of a
