 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives Renee feared Ben was cheating. And with detective Vance

 closing in... - Do you think we need a lawyer? - Lawyers

 won't be necessary, ladies. Susan wanted to flee. If I get caught,

 I could go away for a lot of years. Lynette went to

 Tom for help. You can't go to Paris, not now. I'm an

 accessory to murder. Carlos disappeared from rehab. - He checked himself out

 two hours ago. - What? Why didn't you stop him? My unofficial

 investigation's about to go official. But before he could go public... And

 Bree decided to end it all. Bree van de Kamp had always

 wanted to live her life With elegance and grace. That is also

 how she wanted to die. Her plan was to pour herself a

 glass Of her favorite chardonnay, Put on her most stylish nightgown And

 leave behind a note on embossed stationery. Yes, Bree everything she needed

 for an elegant death. Everything except... Privacy. Thank you, but I don't

 need turndown service. Come back in the morning. And you might want

 to bring a mop. - open the door. - Renee? You have

 to the count of three. One... - This isn't a good time.

 - Two... Seriously, I'm in the middle of something. - Where is

 he? - Who? Ben. The man you're trying to steal from me.

 I don't understand. Do you think I won't hit you? I once

 slapped a waitress because she forgot my croutons! You are dead. Renee,

 please, you have to go. Ever since we met, You've been spouting

 those sunday school phrases, Making folks think you're this grand lady. Well,

 I got your number now, and you are nothing but a middle-aged

 skank in a Nancy Reagan nightie. Why do you have a gun?

 Bree... I asked you a question. Why is there a gun on

 the table? No, don't read that. Bree. please go. Please. Where you

 actually gonna... Oh, my god. Renee Perry had no idea just how

 close her friend had come to suicide, And Bree van de Kamp

 had no idea Just how close she had come to being hit.

 Keeping secrets is a lonely business. That's why we all search for

 someone to confide in-- An ally who will understand... An advisor we

 can trust... A friend who will never judge. Of course, not everyone

 you tell your secrets to... Will be happy about it. Hey. Good

 morning. hey, mom. Look who didn't go to Paris. I know. Your

 dad had to cancel his trip. - Because some work meetings came

 up. - Nice for us, huh? Hey, if you guys are done,

 Why don't you go grab your books? And I'll drop you off

 at school. - Okay. - All right. no. Co-Conspirators to murder do

 not get pancakes. I know that this was the last thing you

 ever expected to have to deal with-- Yeah, you could say that.

 How could you let yourself get involved in this? It's--It's Gaby and

 Carlos' mess. I was... helping a friend. Oh! Helping a friend. because

 when I'd ask you to bring my shirts to the cleaners, That

 was always this big hassle, but burying a body in the woods--

 hey, would you lower your voice? look, I do not know what

 is supposed to happen now. And what, is Chuck gonna just show

 up and arrest you? What? He told Gaby that he was starting

 a formal investigation this morning, S-So... yes, they could arrest me. Damn

 it, Lynette! How could you let this happen?! Out of the four,

 you're supposed to be the smart one. Hey, a-are you guys ready?

 Yeah, I'll meet you at the car. - all right. - okay.

 I need some support right now, not a lecture. Okay, you're right.

 I'm sorry. I will find a way to fix this. and now

 the news. Detective Charles Vance was killed last night in fairview square,

 An apparent victim of a hit and run. The case is currently

 under investigation. Anyone with information, please contact the fairview police department. How

 could he just check himself out?! As I told you on the

 phone, as I replied to your texts, And as I'm telling you

 in person, This is a rehab center, not a jail. Yeah, well,

 it's not much of a rehab center if you let patients out

 in time for happy hour! Please lower your voice. you'll wake the

 crackheads. I'm sorry, but do you have any idea how worried I

 am? My husband has been gone all night. I don't know where

 he is or what he's been doing. Look, even if he did

 have a relapse, I'm sure he'll be back soon. Then we'll call

 you at home, So you should go there. Could you at least

 pretend to care? Not with what I'm paid. You're making a big

 mistake, nursie. I've got a lot of drunk friends, and I'm not

 recommending this place! again, our top story-- Fairview police detective Chuck Vance

 is dead After a hit and run accident That has left the

 community stunned. Detective Vance was crossing lake street Approximately 11:00 p.M. When

 he was run down by a dark sedan. Hello, sunshine. How you

 feelin' this mornin'? Groggy... and nauseous. Mm. I'm afraid that's my fault.

 I slipped a few sedatives in your tea last night And sort

 of forgot to say \"when.\" You drugged me? I had to make

 sure you'd sleep through the night. Didn't wanna find you sprawled out

 on the oriental with your wrists slashed. Spanish omelet? If you really

 want to protect the oriental... you'll put that away. Fine. Let me

 know what you do like for breakfast, And I will make that

 for you tomorrow. Tomorrow? You'll be here tomorrow? And into the foreseeable

 future. Didn't you see my louis vuitton bags upstairs? I'm moving in.

 no, no, no, no, no. You--You don't have to do that. After

 what you tried to do last night, I don't have a choice.

 But I'm fine. Last night was just a moment of temporary insanity.

 In the light of day, I feel absolutely... Did you take the

 laces out of all my sneakers? Yeah, and I also got rid

 of all your knives, razors, Pills, cleaning fluid, and your shower curtain.

 How could I kill myself with a shower curtain? You can't. I

 just thought it was ugly. Okay. See, this is why you can't

 stay here. you will drive me absolutely crazy. Mm. I'd rather see

 you in a straitjacket than a coffin. All right, that's very sweet,

 but I am fine now. It's a brand-new morning, and I am

 loving life. Okay. Now that you are of sound mind, Why did

 you want to kill yourself? It's complicated. I'm sure it is, And

 I'm also sure I'm not going anywhere Till I know exactly what

 made you bring a gun to that motel. Renee, please, this is

 so unnecessary. What's wrong? I... just got some bad news about your

 friend, Chuck Vance. Susan? Susan. Can you help me with my bag?

 No! No, nobody's helping her with her bag. Mike, you're supposed to

 be sleeping. So are you. Where do you think you're going? You

 know where. New york. I wrote it all on the note I

 left on your nightstand. - But I thought-- - Looking good, Mike.

 I thought we discussed this last night. You can't just pick up

 and leave like this. You discussed it. I waited till you went

 to bed, And then I... reconfirmed my plane reservation. Well, if you're

 going, you're going without clothes. Mike! Wh-- Can you wait a sec?

 It feels like you've packed for a month. Three weeks. Felix set

 up meetings with gallery owners, And then if all goes well, we

 can discuss moving there. - I'm not moving to new york. -

 Why not? My plumbing business is here. Well, think how much more

 exciting it'll be. You'll be unclogging pipes in the big city. Okay,

 just stop. This is not about you becoming an artist. - It's

 not? - No. It's about you running away from Chuck Vance. Okay.

 You're right. I'm a mess. One more interrogation by Chuck, And I

 will crack like an egg, and then I'll go to jail And

 take half the neighborhood with me. I'm sorry. I can't risk it.

 You have to let me go. Hey. What's going on? Oh, my

 god. Chuck's dead? It was some sort of hit and run. That's--That's

 all we know. So... what happens now? Nothing. It's all good. The

 only person tying us to alejandro's murder is gone. Gaby, he was

 Bree's boyfriend. Yeah, and if she'd dumped him when I told her,

 We wouldn't have gotten in trouble in the first place. If you're

 done, I think it's time That we ask the obvious question. Which

 is? Did somebody do this on purpose? Oh, my god. He was

 murdered? No! No, no, no, no, no. It was an accident. It

 does seem a bit... convenient. Well, maybe god decided to answer our

 prayers Through one of his drunk-driving angels on earth. who are we

 to question god? Look, okay, I admit we were in a lot

 of trouble there, But none of us are that cold-blooded, right? Could

 it be someone's trying to protect us? Oh, my god. Carlos. -

 Hey. - Carlos couldn't have done it. He's still in rehab, isn't

 he? Of course he is! Oh, my god, you guys. We finally

 get a lucky break. Let's just go with it. We wanted Chuck

 gone, and now he's gone. It's just a coincidence. Coincidence? Yes, Bree,

 coincidences happen, Otherwise there wouldn't be a word for them. So, uh,

 I guess we should just put this behind us And... get back

 to normal. Sounds like a plan. Are we good, Susan? Sure. Bree?

 We all agree this was just an accident? If you say so.

 Tom? Tom, I've got big news! You are not gonna believe what

 has happened to-- - Bob? - What did you do? - Huh?

 - You buried a man in the woods? She was merely helping

 a friend. Don't forget that. You t-told Bob? Of course I told

 Bob. If they arrest you, You're gonna need an attorney. Tom, I

 just found out that everybody I invited To my last barbecue is

 involved in murder, And this is water. Scotch. Coming right up. You

 shouldn't have done that. We don't need a lawyer. We have to

 prepare for the worst, Lynette. I am not gonna have the kids

 visit you behind bars Next mother's day. No, no, listen to me.

 Chuck Vance died last night. - What? - Hit by a car.

 Oh, my god! Was that you guys, too? No! Are you serious?

 And--And Chuck was the only one who knew about the... Yeah. okay.

 So, Bob... I guess we're not gonna need you after all. But

 if you want, you can totally bill me for this hour. Count

 on it. Taking this scotch. So it's over? I think so. Okay,

 what's wrong? Huh? The one man who could have put us all

 in jail is gone. We're home free, but you're still sitting there,

 More depressed than ever. I'd like to know why. I don't know.

 Are you... upset that Chuck got killed? A little. Not so much.

 Well, then why are you getting all misty? I don't know. Why

 don't you? Why are you getting mad? Because we've been riding this

 emotional roller coaster For months now, and I'm ready to get off.

 Well, I'm sorry if I'm not all giggles and sunshine, But I

 am walking around with a pretty big secret. So what? Everybody's got

 a secret. Not as big as mine. I helped bury a body.

 And our mechanic does crystal meth. Our butcher beats up homeless guys,

 And the librarian's a nymphomaniac. The world is filled With ordinary people

 that do nasty things. So man up or dump the guilt. Let's

 get on with our lives. I know you're right. Uh... It makes

 no sense for me to be depressed, And I know alejandro was

 a bad guy. And he deserved to die. He did. He absolutely

 did. Why are you still so... I don't know. But I'll figure

 it out. I swear. Thank you. Our librarian's a nymphomaniac? I made

 that up. 'Cause I always got a vibe. Let's just eat. -

 Detective murphy - Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to stop by and

 say how sorry I was To hear about officer Vance. It's so

 tragic. Any idea who could have done this? Who are you? Oh,

 I'm gabrielle solis. I met Chuck through his girlfriend, Bree van de

 Kamp. She's a friend of mine. Woman's a first class bitch. Who

 I rarely talk to 'cause of the bitch thing. Ahem. So, um,

 were there any witnesses? Everyone here knows what she did to Chuck--

 Led him on and then broke his heart like it was nothing.

 Can't believe he wanted to marry her. Yeah, I know. Marrying Bree

 would have been the worst thing To ever happen to him. Well,

 second worst. So any clues-- Anything at all? Not yet. Excuse me.

 Um... Well, you know what I think happened? - Drunk teenagers hitting

 people with cars. - Yeah. It's a rite of passage with them,

 like spring break. If I were you guys, I'd be checking the

 grills Of every acne-covered kid within a 100-mile radius. It wasn't an

 accident. It wasn't? There were no skid marks, No attempt to slow

 down or swerve. Whoever did this was gunning for Chuck. So... anyone

 get the make of the car Or... race of the driver? No,

 ma'am, but we're monitoring every body shop in the state. Oh. Okay.

 Don't worry. A cop was killed. We'll find whoever's responsible, And when

 we do, they are gonna pay, big-time. Okay. I'll be sure to

 tell Bree. That bitch! How's the history project coming? Good. I'm drawing

 a picture of lincoln's assassination. Um... sweetie, I don't think he was

 shot with a stapler. That's a gun, and I think we're done

 here. Sorry for just dropping by without calling, Especially with the way

 things have been between us lately. What's wrong? It's this whole Chuck

 thing. Hey, penny, would you mind throwing those clothes In the washing

 machine for me? Sure. Thanks. Come on in. You don't think it

 was an accident, do you? No. Who could do something like that?

 It had to be someone who was trying to protect us. But

 that means they would have to know about what we did. Who

 else knows? I mean, other than the four of us and Carlos?

 Well, Susan told Mike. - And I told Ben. - And I

 told Tom. - You told Tom? - Well, you told Ben. Okay,

 so Ben and Mike and Tom, but that's it, right? No one

 else has been told? No one. Except Tom told Bob. We're gonna

 need to write this down. Okay, the people who were there are

 in orange. The people who were told by people who were there

 Are in blue, and the green arrows represent Who told whom. Wow.

 We may be good at arts and crafts, But we suck at

 conspiracy. What's the purple question mark? That's whoever wrote the letter. You

 think they killed Chuck? Who knows? We're not sure why the letter

 was sent In the first place. \"I know what you did. It

 makes me sick. I'm going to tell\"? Sounds like a threat to

 me. But why kill someone else who has the same goal? It

 doesn't make any sense. None of it makes any sense. I mean,

 we know these people. None of them would commit a cold-blooded murder.

 Oh, god. What if someone else knows? Hey. How are the girls?

 Juanita demanded ice cream for lunch. What'd you say? She's bigger than

 me. What do you think I said? And don't give me that

 look. You said you'd be home by feeding time. Sorry. I've been

 all over town looking for my husband. Carlos went a.W.O.L. From rehab

 last night, and I have no idea where he is. Want a

 hint? You know? He dragged his can upstairs about two hours ago,

 Drunk as a red sox pitcher in the bottom of the 9th.

 Karen, I don't know how to thank you. I'm on a fixed

 income. Let's use our imagination? Oh, thank god! I was so worried!

 Where were you last night? You can tell me the truth. I

 won't judge. I'll be totally supportive. Wake up, you pathetic boozehound! Where

 the hell were you last night?! Oh, where am I now? Ohh!

 I'm home! No, no, no, no, no, no. Open your eyes. Focus.

 Okay, after you checked yourself out of rehab, You got in the

 car. Where did you go? I drove to a bar. I drank

 a lot of shots... And I don't remember much else. Do you

 remember killing someone? Huh? Oh, look who's sober now. What are you

 talking about? Chuck Vance was killed last night by a hit and

 run driver. Chuck's dead? And you think I did it? Well... You

 think I killed someone? Ahem. Alejandro. It's not like potato chips, Gaby!

 You were upset, and you were drinking. He was hit on lake

 street. That's only a few blocks from the rehab center. I don't

 remember. You have to. The police are all over this thing. They're

 looking for witnesses. They're trying to find the car. Oh, wait. That's

 it. The car. All we have to do is check the car.

 If you hit him, it'll be obvious. Honey, where's your car? That's

 a really good question. Why did you turn the light on? I'm

 checking up on you. How you doing? Fine. Really? 'Cause last night

 you were suicidal, And that was before you found out your boyfriend

 was dead. I would think you'd be an emotional mess Right about

 now. It's been an interesting couple of days, But I'm holding my

 own. See, here's my problem. I don't believe you. You don't have

 to believe me. All you have to do is turn off the

 light as you leave the room. Bree, you need to talk about

 this. Repressing your feelings is not healthy. And since when are you

 a therapist? Uh, excuse me. I took intro to psych And once

 slept with my shrink. I think I'm qualified. Well, as impressive as

 those credentials are, My feelings are not your concern. They became my

 concern when I caught you About to swallow the business end of

 a smith & wesson. Now I'm not leaving this room until you

 tell me why. I can't. Other people are involved-- People that you

 know. Well... I can keep my mouth shut. Renee... Oh, you can

 trust me. We're friends, right? Not really. Not really? I'm not trying

 to be rude. Yes, I mean, we're-- Well, we socialize. You've been

 to my home. I've been to yours. We're friendly, But that doesn't

 make us friends. Okay. You know what I mean. You and I

 don't talk about important things. We've never had a deep conversation. We're

 not... Friends. And now I've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.

 Don't worry about me. I'm fine. And by the way, I don't

 think you have any friends. In fact, I don't think you care

 about anyone at all, Because if you did, you never would have

 considered Splattering your brains against the wall Of some cheap motel. Okay,

 that's it. Would you please get out of my house? No! Not

 until I'm convinced you are no longer A danger to yourself. I

 will not allow anyone to kill themselves, Not on my watch. I

 will not go through that again. This is a funeral. You have

 got to stop smiling. Sorry. I'm just so relieved. I really thought

 I was dead in the water there. Yeah, we were very lucky.

 Listen, I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for

 me. It's no big deal. One minute you're boarding a plane to

 Paris, Then the next, you rush to my side. Well, you do

 know in spite of everything, You still mean the world to me?

 If I didn't before, I do now. Hey, I-I know it's not

 Paris, But you wanna come over later for movie night with the

 kids? That'd be great. I'll bring a pizza so you don't have

 to cook. Fantastic. Lynette. Sorry. Here you go, dear. Oh. Thank you.

 I can't believe I forgot to bring tissue to a funeral. Oh,

 you keep it. I don't really cry at funerals, Not anymore. No?

 No. Well, when you're young, Death always comes as such a shock,

 As if the universe is unfair. But when you get to my

 age, You realize that death is just the end of the story.

 The phone call comes. You shed a few tears, And then you

 get together and celebrate the life that was. That's it. - What?

 - Thank you so much! You will never know how helpful you've

 been. Oh, I'm so glad. Were you close with my nephew? -

 Oh, no. - Oh. Ah. But he did interrogate me once. He

 did a lovely job. Hey, Gaby, have you got a minute? listen.

 What was alejandro's alias? seriously? We're talking about this here? Chuck told

 me in my interrogation, But I can't remember. - Pablo? Paco? -

 Ramon sanchez. Right, right, and he was living in... Oklahoma City. What

 do you need this for? I... w-wanna light a candle for him,

 And I thought I should know all of his names. You only

 light candles for people who you want to bless. That's right, and

 he was a bad guy. I'm gonna go blow out that candle.

 What the hell are we doing here? There are cops everywhere. It's

 a cop funeral. What'd you expect? Clowns? I am taking a huge

 risk by being here. No, you're paying your respects. That's what innocent

 people do. Okay. If I'm so innocent, Then why is that cop

 staring at me? Just stop acting so guilty. He takes one look

 at your face, And you say-- Hi, officer. Hello. Carlos, right? Remember

 me? No. I'm not surprised. You were pretty wasted When you came

 into the station the other night. you went to the police station?

 Yeah. He said he wanted to make a confession-- Something about beating

 somebody with a candlestick? Oh, Carlos, you shouldn't have done that. What

 else did he say? Well, that's when the news came in about

 detective Vance, And, uh, all hell broke loose. By the time things

 settled, he was gone. So who's this person you assaulted? Oh! Uh...

 That would be me. You? Yeah. I'm a bit of a handful.

 You hit your wife with a candlestick? He hit me back. In

 his defense, I'd just popped him with a baseball bat. So do

 you wanna file charges? Or do you? Oh! We're good. This thing

 we got isn't pretty, but it works. So who was it? Who

 was what? the person you knew who committed suicide. That's something I

 only discuss with friends. It was my mother. She'd tried it once

 before. Pills. But I found her in time. And then... one morning

 I saw that look in her eyes again. Not... sad, just... Empty.

 She swore to me she'd be fine, so I... I went to

 school. And by the time I got back... Well... how was I

 supposed to know she was gonna pull it off this time? Oh,

 Renee, I am so sorry. yeah. That's what the note said-- \"I'm

 sorry.\" That's it. I don't have a mom for the rest of

 my life, And she thinks those two little words... Are gonna make

 up for that? Many years ago, A neighbor and a good friend

 of ours... Took her life. And that left us all heartbroken and

 perplexed. But somehow, when I was alone in that hotel room, I

 forgot about all the pain she caused. In those awful moments, I

 thought maybe she had the answer. But then you showed up. Thank

 god. You will always be the person who saved my life. And

 now that I've had time to think about it... I realize that

 makes you the best friend I'll ever have. Hey! Look who's here

 with a pizza and a dvd. Ooh, mario's. That's excellent. Mom, you

 let dad pick out the movie? Hey, my taste in movies is

 as good as my taste in pizza. Great, that means the pizza's

 gonna be black and white and three hours long. Oh, excuse me.

 \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Marty,\" \"Casablanca\"-- What do all these movies have in common?

 We fell asleep during them? They're classics. \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"

 Here's looking at my iPhone, dad. Hey! Be nice. I'm sure your

 dad picked out something really fun this time. What'd you get? \"Old

 yeller.\" Oh, Tom, you make this so hard. Why? What I've seen

 of it is great. My folks always sent me to bed before

 the ending. Is there--Is there swearing or something? Eh. Something. How about

 we eat? Huh. Everything good? Yeah. It's just, you never remember I

 like the thin crust. But it doesn't matter. Thank you for getting

 it. Who's hungry? - mmm. - oh, I am. Good news. The

 police found the car. You left it in their parking lot. Thank

 god. Mrs. Mccluskey's gonna drive us over there after breakfast, Then I

 will drive you back to rehab. Sounds like a plan. Babe. I'm

 sorry about all this. I know I've put you and the kids

 through so much. I'm gonna try and get back here as soon

 as I can. You forget about us. You just worry about getting

 better. I can hold down the fort. No problem. I have something

 else I need to tell you. What's that? I love you. I

 know you know that. I just don't think we say it enough.

 I love you, too. One more thing. What? If you ever go

 to the police again And confess something without talking to me first,

 I will be burying another body in the woods. You got it?

 Good. I'll see you in the morning. Hey, you want a beer?

 Oh, you got the belgian kind? - I love that stuff. -

 I know. Thanks for clearing the table. I believe that has been

 the hardest part Of our separation. God, for me? It's the laundry.

 - I-I found out I am more inclined to buy new socks...

 - Ah. Than to wash the dirty ones. Hey, thanks again for

 giving up your trip. It really meant a lot to me. No

 problem. And please apologize to Jane. She must be furious. I doubt

 it. She's not really like that. Tom, I know women. There's a

 Lynette voodoo doll being dropped off the eiffel tower as we speak.

 no, it's weird, but, uh, Jane doesn't hang on to anger. Ah.

 Uh, okay. You don't--You don't-- You don't know her. She's-- She's very

 forgiving. Ah. Fine. Got it. She's terrific. Well, I'll give you an

 example. She would never criticize the pizza I brought over. What? Well,

 you had to point out that I didn't get the thin crust.

 I know, I know. The second I said it, I realized I

 shouldn't have. It just... came out. Exactly. It's just a-- It's a

 reflex for you. You can't help it. Well... Maybe that's because I

 keep hoping if I say something enough, you'll finally hear me. I

 mean... 23 years of telling you the kind of pizza I like,

 And it still doesn't occur to you to get it. It makes

 me feel like I don't matter. Wow, I didn't realize. I know.

 I shouldn't have compared you to Jane. that wasn't right. That's okay.

 She's really good to you, huh? Then I think you should go

 to Paris. What? Yeah. 'Cause otherwise, you'll always wonder if she could

 make you happy. And didn't we say that was the point of

 us separating? Could I still stay and watch the movie? Of course.

 Susan? You gotta be kidding me. Susan, what do you think you're

 doing? Oh, I remember this house. The half naked guy runs out,

 and I don't get my fare. - Here. Huh? - Oh, no,

 no, put that back. You'll get your fare this time. Honey, I'm

 sorry, but I have to go. - I-It's all in my note.

 - What is it with you and notes lately? You were asleep

 when I came home from the funeral. Well, if you're taking off

 to new york, you wake me up! I'm not going to new

 york. I'm going to oklahoma. And now I'm... just confused. okay, two

 minutes. you asked me why I still feel so guilty. I finally

 figured it out. He got a phone call. - Who got a

 phone call? - Alejandro. When we were putting his body into the

 ground,His phone rang. Do you know what that means? He had really

 good cell phone service? It means he has a family, And they

 have no idea where he is. It must be tearing them apart.

 I mean, he did something horrible, not them. They shouldn't have to

 suffer, too. And what exactly are you gonna do about it? I'm

 not sure yet. I just know I have to see if they're

 okay. I think it's the only way I'm ever getting back to

 normal. well, then I guess you gotta go. Hey! Where are you

 off to? I'm just... visiting some family. Oh, that sounds like fun.

 Well, have a good trip. It's a lonely business keeping secrets. That's

 why we all search for someone we can confide in... An ally

 who will understand. An advisor we can trust. A friend who will

 never judge. Yes, we all need help hiding The darkest truths of

 our lives. Because as soon as you've told one secret... Another is
