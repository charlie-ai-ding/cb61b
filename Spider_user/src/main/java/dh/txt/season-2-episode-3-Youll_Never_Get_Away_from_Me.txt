 on Desperate Housewives: As one affair ends... We don't have to sneak

 around. We can have a real relationship. ...another begins. - Edie! I

 asked if she'd like to live together. She said yes. - And

 yet another... - This is Rex's mother, Phyllis. - Claims. This is

 Joe Flannery. - Are you aware my daughter-in-law - has a boyfriend?

 ...is exposed. It won't break your heart to leave those sad faces?

 And while some people can't wait to get out of the house,

 others are being kept there against their will. Which one is Rex's

 headstone? I always forget. It's right down this row. Oh, yes. That's

 right. Over the years, Bree Van De Kamp had grown increasingly concerned

 over her mother-in-law's forgetfulness. Oh, honey, did I forget to take the

 pins out of that dress? Her lapses had become more frequent... Sweetie,

 didn't I tell you I was gonna paint that chair? ...more glaring...

 Oh, dear. Didn't I mention I waxed the floor? ...and more dangerous.

 Yes, Bree was worried about Phyllis's faulty memory. But she was more

 than happy to remind her. Especially when it came to the important

 things. So have you given any thought to when you might be

 ending your visit? - What? - Have I become a burden? Is

 that what you're saying? I was simply asking when you were planning

 to leave. There was no agenda behind the question. Oh, I... I

 don't know. Why don't we play it by ear. Yes. Let's. What

 on earth? Oh, my God. What happened? It looks like someone dug

 Rex up. Well, I got that. But why? Why would they do

 that? Why, I don't know. Unless... Unless what? Maybe this has something

 to do with that insurance investigator. Insurance investigator? He came by asking

 all sorts of questions. I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe

 you were at the store. Anyway, he was very suspicious. - Suspicious?

 - Oh, yes. He has a theory that Rex didn't die of

 a heart attack. He thinks he was poisoned. It was in that

 moment Bree could finally see the truth. Did I not mention that?

 Her mother-in-law's memory was fine. It was her soul that was faulty.

 The parties took place on the front lawn of 4347 Wisteria Lane

 every Sunday afternoon. Chloe Pendergast would bring the tea set, which was

 appropriate, since she was the hostess. Brittany Kreiss provided formal attire from

 her mother's closet. How are you? And Marissa Ann McKay invited the

 additional guests, some of whom hadn't been to a party in years.

 Of course, it never occurred to the three young girls that while

 they were busy playing out their fantasy... ...one of the older girls

 in the neighbourhood was engaging in a fantasy of her own. -

 Hey. - Oh, hi, Mrs Solis. - Ralph. - Off to the

 mall again? You know me. There was nothing Gabrielle enjoyed as much

 as shopping. And even when she couldn't afford to take anything home,

 she took satisfaction in looking... ...at the merchandise. Hey, Susan. What's going

 on? It's Karl's weekend to have Julie, and they're always back by

 six. That's our custody agreement. And it's after six. - It's like

 6.15. - Well, see? There you go. I'm sure they just forgot.

 Well, I have a court order. It's out of my hands. It'd

 still be nice if you gave them a grace period. Oh, I'm

 being nice. I could have him arrested. I mean, don't get me

 wrong. I'm all for Julie spending time with Karl. He is still

 her dad, and she loves him. - But? - But he's with

 Edie! I mean, she's not exactly the maternal type. I wouldn't be

 a good mother if I wasn't concerned. Who knows what passes for

 a kid-friendly good time in there? Drugs? Porn? Smoking? Doesn't sound like

 they're having an orgy in there. Well, obviously they saw us coming.

 That's a strike. - Hey, guys! - Hey, Mommy. Hey! Look who's

 here. Parker, guess what I got. - What? - School supplies. -

 School supplies? - Yeah. And the best part of it is, I

 got you a really cool backpack. Whoa, look at that. Pretty neat,

 huh? Wow. Thanks. So on your first day of school, you and

 your dad can find your cubby, and you can hang it up.

 You're not taking me? Your dad's gonna take you to school on

 your first day. Just me and you, big guy. I'll be right

 there to hold your hand. But I thought Mommy was taking me.

 Yeah, well, honey, I have to work. Mommy's boss is a mean,

 mean lady, and if I miss work, I'll lose my job. And

 then we won't have any money to buy food. Honey, you gotta

 believe me. If I could be there, you know that I would.

 All right. I didn't know it was that important. I will talk

 to my boss, and I will see what I can do. Thank

 you, Mommy. Wow, I don't wanna rain on your parade, but he

 just totally manipulated you. Well, hey, when a kid's that good, you

 gotta give him his due. An autopsy? Detective, Rex died of a

 heart attack. Well, there were some anomalies in the doctor's report. Anomalies?

 What anomalies? Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss this

 any further with you. - Am I a suspect? - I didn't

 say that. Well, if I am, you're wasting your time. I loved

 Rex, and anyone who knows me will tell you that I was

 incapable of hurting him. You sure about that? You talked to Phyllis!

 Again, I can't discuss the case. She's my mother-in-law. Of course she

 said horrible things about me. Lower your voice. She blamed me for

 every problem Rex and I had. So there were problems? It was

 a marriage. Of course there were problems. May I record this, so

 there's no confusion over your statement? - No, you may not record

 this! - You refuse to make a statement? I'm not refusing anything.

 I'm saying, stay away from Phyllis! She's a... she's a raving loon!

 Ma'am, perhaps you'd be more comfortable with an attorney present. You want

 a statement? Fine. I'll give you a statement. My husband died of

 a heart attack. I loved him very deeply. And your mother did

 a lousy job! To Bree's way of thinking, there were two kinds

 of people in the world. Those who were useless before their morning

 coffee... ...and those who weren't. What's going on? Don't rush me, Bree!

 I'm an old woman. Don't rush me. Get her out of here.

 I will tell you one thing. You wouldn't be acting this way

 if you didn't feel guilty about something! What's the occasion? Our anniversary.

 Oh, right. How could you forget our anniversary? You sit in a

 cell all day long staring at a calendar! What's the big deal?

 Our marriage was a sham anyway. - Not this again. - In

 real marriages, wives are faithful. Yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries. So I

 guess we're even. You equate forgetting our anniversary with cheating? You are

 clearly determined to ruin this special day for us. What is wrong

 that you don't feel guilty? - I feel tons of guilt, so

 back off! - You never even apologised. I apologised a million times.

 But you always followed it up with an excuse. \"I was Ionely.\"

 \"You weren't home.\" \"A woman needs to be loved.\" A woman does

 need to be loved. And since you didn't give it to me,

 I had to find it elsewhere. So that's what the teenager was

 doing in our bedroom. Filling you with love. Say what you want,

 but John Rowland loved me like no one ever has. Not as

 a trophy or as a possession, but for me. He loved me.

 No, he really did. Let me count the ways. Gently, savagely, frequently,

 upside down... Is there a problem here? No. It's our anniversary. We're

 just reliving the good times. That's an amazing car. Aston Martin, right?

 Brand-new. Limited edition. A little anniversary present from my husband. He's very

 generous. More than he knows. I'm sorry, what? I'm singing at church

 for the Family Follies. Edie's going to accompany me on guitar. She's

 really good. So you and Edie are gonna be an act. Is

 that a problem? No! No. I mean, I'm a little surprised that

 you didn't ask me to accompany you first. On what? You don't

 play an instrument. I play the piano. You know that. How would

 I know that? I've never seen you play. Well, I played in

 high school. So the last time you tickled the ivories was sometime

 in the late '70s? It was the early '80s. Well, I'm not

 gonna argue with you. You want to do the show with Edie,

 and I think that's super. So she's really good, huh? She knows

 her guitar. Apparently there were a lot of musicians in her family,

 like the Von Trapps. Except, you know, her brother OD'd. All I'm

 asking is to play a little ball. Is that such a big

 deal? Matthew, you are such an excellent player, that people will want

 to be your friend. Then the next thing you know, God knows

 who will be wanting to drop by and calling. Sweetie, we need

 to keep a low profile. Yeah, but I have got to get

 out of this house sometime. I'm going crazy here. OK? What is

 it? My daughter is singing a song at church. I want to

 accompany her on the piano and haven't played in years. You were

 so amazing at Rex's funeral the other day, - I was wondering...

 - I don't give lessons. Oh, OK. You have a little... on

 your... I'm baking cherry pie. Excuse me. What happened to maintaining a

 low profile? You keep being rude to everybody, they're gonna start whispering

 about us. You're right. We do want to fit in. Lynette! Check

 it out. Jason's mouth. Stu, isn't that the new videoconference setup? Yeah.

 Isn't the resolution fantastic? Hey, Nina. About tomorrow morning. You know how

 the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow? Cos

 I've got this thing... Good God! This is not about your kids

 again, is it? I know, I promised I wouldn't do this, but

 Parker really needs me to be there on his first day of

 kindergarten. - He's freaked out I can't be there... - I'm sorry.

 How is this my problem? Because we can't escape the fact that

 I have kids. I love my job, but to be fair, there's

 got to be some balance. OK, how about the people that don't

 have the kids? Did you ever consider that they might need balance

 in their lives? Maybe they want to go see a matinee. Perhaps

 they want to come in late after a big crazy night out.

 Or maybe they just want to get a haircut, which I myself

 have not been able to do for two months. So no, this

 is about fairness to the people who are childless by choice. OK?

 OK. Good point. And I'm sorry about your hair. I can see

 why you're upset. - Open wide. - Not now, Stu. Hang on

 a sec. I don't understand. This system is gonna let Mommy be

 with you on your first day of school. The resolution is fantastic.

 The next day, Gabrielle decided to cheer herself up with another round

 of window-shopping. But this time, she was taken aback by what was

 on display. - Mrs Tillman. - Mr Delfino. I heard you were

 back from the hospital. I brought you these. I can't tell you

 how long it's been since I got flowers from a handsome man.

 I mean, I could, but I don't want your pity. Where are

 you off to? I'm going back to Utah for a few weeks.

 The recuperation is taking longer than the doctors anticipated. Speaking of my

 attack, have they caught young Zachary yet? No. Actually, that's why I'm

 here. So the flowers were just a ruse. Figures. I'm trying to

 find Zach before he gets into more trouble. Do you know any

 friends he might have, anywhere he might be holed up? I know

 you were close to him. Funny thing. Since he beat me and

 threw me down the stairs, we just don't stay in touch like

 we should. Since when do you care so much about Zach Young?

 It's complicated. I'll bet. I'm sure he's out there somewhere, trying to

 find his father. Which I trust you made impossible. No. I let

 Paul go. I couldn't go through with it. That was a mistake.

 He will spend the rest of his life running from the police.

 I think that's punishment enough. Zach is the only connection that Paul

 has with his dead wife. At some point, he will run back

 here looking for him. I don't like to be negative, but you

 really should have killed him. At the risk of ruining a lovely

 evening, I have some unpleasant news. The police dug up your father

 today. - What? - Why? Well, apparently they want to do an

 autopsy. They don't think he had a heart attack. They think somebody

 was poisoning him. - Who would have poisoned Daddy? - Well, apparently,

 I'm a suspect. Well, they always look at spouses first. It has

 something to do with statistics. It's just a formality. I'll be cleared

 in no time. Would you two stop looking at me like that?

 Obviously, I did not kill your father! I loved him deeply. But

 you and Dad had a lot of problems. Everyone knows that. Yes,

 we had issues, but I would never have hurt him. The night

 Daddy had his second heart attack? You loved him a lot to

 make the bed before taking him to the hospital. I was in

 shock, Danielle. You know that. Andrew, surely you don't think I murdered

 your father. Oh, I know you didn't. You're not capable of murder.

 - Thank you. - That wasn't a compliment. It takes guts to

 kill somebody. Thank you for changing your mind about helping me. I

 really appreciate it. I'm happy to help. And... I'm sorry if I

 seemed rude before. I... I was having a bad day. That's good.

 That's really good. You might want to lay off the pedal. Really?

 Oh, I thought it made it sound more professional. It doesn't. Boy,

 your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud. The good

 news is it drowns out the sound of the dryer. Arch your

 fingers, Susan. Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt. I knocked, but I guess

 you guys didn't hear me. No, we heard you. We were just

 hoping that whoever it was would go away. I'm still hoping that'll

 happen. What's up, Mom? Well, I have good news. I've been taking

 piano lessons with Betty Applewhite, and... Well, I just thought maybe I

 could join you guys. Like a trio. Doesn't that sound fun? I

 don't do trios. But thanks anyway. Well, I don't mean to be

 technical here, but this show? I mean, it really is supposed to

 be a family thing. And I hate to point out, you're not

 family. No, but I have talent. And to most audiences, talent trumps

 family. Well, what makes you so sure I don't have talent? Just

 a hunch. Yeah, well, we've all seen your talent, which is a

 nice way of telling you, - \"Put curtains on your bedroom window.\"

 - Guys! Be honest. You didn't want any part of this until

 you found out I was involved. That is so not true. Oh,

 yes, it is. It burns you that your own daughter picked me

 over you. She did not pick you. It just didn't occur to

 her I would agree to do it. Now she knows, and if

 she had it to do over again, she'd pick me. No, she

 wouldn't. Why don't we put it to a test? Who would you

 rather have play with you? - Oh, no. No, no, no. -

 No, it's OK, honey. Who do you want to be with you

 in the family talent show? Yes. Who do you want with you

 in front of all of those people? And remember, it's church. They

 are going to be judging you. OK. Well, first of all, you

 both suck. But if I had to choose... ...I guess I'd... pick

 my mom. Sorry, Edie. Fair enough. I'd like my pitch pipe back,

 please. It was you, wasn't it? Hello, John. Long time, no see.

 One of the neighbours saw an Aston Martin driving away, and what

 do you know? Well, someone had to tend to the yard. You

 were busy elsewhere. - You saw us? - Yes. She's old enough

 to be your mother. Hell, she's old enough to be my mother!

 Joan's only 41. Joan? You're calling her Joan? - Why shouldn't I?

 She's my friend. - I know your friends, and you don't do

 to your friends what I saw you doing to that wrinkly old

 lady! OK! So you caught me doing it with somebody else. What's

 the big deal? - You're supposed to be in love with me!

 - What? How many times did you whisper, \"You're the only woman

 I'll ever love\"? I don't know. A bunch. Were you lying? Trying

 to get me into bed? No, of course not. I loved you,

 but we broke up. Five minutes ago! Haven't you ever heard of

 a mourning period? I know it seems quick, but I have feelings

 for her. In fact, I think I may be in love with

 her. Oh, my God. What's the matter? Is it the baby? No.

 Oh, no, no. It's me. I am beyond stupid! You're not stupid.

 Oh, no, I am. Yesterday I was still fantasising that it could

 work with you, that a one-bedroom apartment might be cosy. - Mrs

 Solis, please... - Oh, my God. I almost left my husband for

 someone who calls me Mrs Solis. So, are you upset because you

 want to get back together? Because I can break up with Joan.

 That's OK, sweetie. I'm good. So this is it for us? I

 really feel like we should end it better than this. Actually, John,

 given how stupid both of us have been, this is an entirely

 appropriate ending. Mrs Van De Kamp. What can I do for you?

 I would like to submit myself to a lie detector test to

 eliminate any uncertainty about what happened with my husband. Sure you don't

 want a lawyer present? I'll waive all that. My only stipulation is

 that I want my children to be able to see me answer

 the questions. I think we can accommodate you. Is your name Bree

 Van De Kamp? Yes. Were you married to Rex Van De Kamp?

 Yes. Did you and your husband temporarily separate last year? Yes. Did

 you kill your husband? No. Do you know a man named George

 Williams? Yes. During your separation from your husband, did you have a

 relationship with Mr Williams? What does that have to do with anything?

 Just yes or no responses, please. Well, I'm not gonna respond to

 something that's none of your business. Mrs Van De Kamp, if you

 want us to take this polygraph seriously, answer the questions we ask.

 OK? Who's George Williams? He's our pharmacist. During your separation, did you

 have a relationship with Mr Williams? Yes. Are you in love with

 Mr Williams? - What? - Are you in love with Mr Williams?

 No. I... I was thinking of something else just then. So why

 don't you ask me the question again. Are you in love with

 Mr Williams? No. Did you see that? Yeah. I saw it. Hello,

 Susan. Are you ready for your lesson? Yep. I am. I think

 I'm gonna make another push for using that pedal. I think it

 adds grandeur. - I wanna talk to you. - I'm busy now.

 I cannot believe you kicked Edie out of Julie's performance! I did

 not kick Edie out. Julie made that call. Because you played the

 \"mom\" card! Well, it is a family recital, and Edie is not

 family. - One day she could be. - Don't even joke like

 that. How about your plumberlconvicted murderer, huh? He seems to keep popping

 up at \"family\" events. Not murder, it was manslaughter. That's totally different.

 We don't live together. He cares about Julie. So does Edie! She

 was really looking forward to performing with Julie. If you think Edie

 Britt cares about anybody other than herself, you are living in a

 fool's paradise. You don't know her the way I do, and the

 only reason she's interested in Julie is to mess with my head.

 Hey, that's both crazy and self-absorbed. That's a twofer! Way to go!

 Whether you choose to believe it or not, they're great together. And

 if you don't believe me, ask Julie. I'm sorry you had to

 witness that. Oh, it's OK, hon. I have lived my share of

 family knockdown-dragouts. Well, I hope it wasn't as ugly as me and

 Karl. You'd be surprised. Parker? Honey, can you hear me? Tom, why

 isn't he talking? There are a lot of kids here. He's a

 little stressed. - Parker, say hi. Say hi. - Mommy? Oh, hey,

 honey! This is so exciting! Your first day of school. You're gonna

 make so many friends. Lynette. Staff meeting. Now. Right. Yeah. I'm gonna

 be right there. Now, now, now, now! Stu, this coffee is cold.

 Honey, I'm gonna be right back. Mommy, where are you going? Right

 back! Mommy, come back. OK, let's turn to page five. Damn! I

 forgot my prospectus. Any extra copies? No? Be right back. Hi, I'm

 back. How's he doing? Honey, he's upset because he wanted to show

 you his cubby. You left. Oh, honey, I'm here. I'm here. You

 can show me your cubby now. Nina found extra copies. She wants

 you back now. OK... I'll be back in two seconds, sweetie. Mommy,

 Mommy, don't go! So the big issue here is second-quarter billing. -

 Where are you going? - Ladies' room. - No. - Nina, nature

 is calling. Lynette, hold it for ten minutes. We have to get

 though this. What I'd like to do is trade out the invoicing

 structure. Let's take a look at our graphs on page ten, please.

 Lynette had been struggling to balance her career and her family. She

 finally saw an opportunity to tip the scales in her favour. ...badgering

 clients with invoices on short-term campaigns, - I say we bill on

 delivery. - Yes! Bill on delivery! Yes! Are you having a seizure?

 No. No, I'm just... I'm very excited. It's a really good plan.

 Yeah. Now, what happened on the Berman account is that they were

 sent duplicate bills by Tina and Ron in Accounting. And I'm not

 pointing any fingers, but Tina, Ron, about walking in and seeing all

 my lines lit up with disgruntled... Hot! Hot! Help! Stu! That's why

 we packed you extra cookies, so you could share - with all

 your new friends. Remember? - I think we're good to go now,

 honey. You're gonna be great, Parker. I love you. I love you

 too, Mommy. Bree. Hi! What can I do for you? For starters,

 you can help me prove to the police that we didn't conspire

 to kill my husband. OK. Because of the anomalies in Rex's blood,

 the police wondered if I'd been poisoning Rex. Absurd. Lots of things

 can cause high potassium levels. Renal failure, low sodium... That's why I

 took the polygraph, to prove to them I was innocent. Obviously, you

 passed. Sort of. I think the police now have a different theory,

 which is, if I wasn't poisoning Rex on my own, then maybe...

 you were helping me. - You're kidding. - No. That's why I

 need you to take the polygraph too. What? It's the quickest way

 to prove the police are wrong. I don't understand. We're just friends.

 Why would the police assume that people in a platonic relationship would

 want to murder someone? During the test, they asked me some questions

 about you and... us and whether we had a relationship. And I

 said yes, because it's true. And then they asked me something else.

 Something I hadn't considered. Which was? They asked me if I loved

 you. What did you say? I said, \"No.\" But according to the

 polygraph, that wasn't exactly true. Well, I don't... I don't know if

 that means anything. Polygraphs aren't completely reliable. I think, perhaps, the machine

 picked up on something. Something that I wasn't aware of. Wow. That's

 why I need you to take the test and answer the detective's

 questions. I'm not gonna know exactly how I feel until we put

 this behind us. - But then once we do... - We can

 move on. Can those Cicarelli sisters dance or what? Wow, look out

 Broadway. Don't forget that we will have cookies and juice set up

 in the basement after we're done here. We want to see you

 all there. And for our next act, please welcome the musical stylings

 of Julie and Susan Mayer. I'll be right back. Oh, I'm just

 gonna need a couple of seconds. So feel free to pray. Edie,

 the other day, when I saw you making music with my family,

 I got a little jealous, and I went a little crazy, and

 I pushed you out. Seeing you sitting here today... Well, I can

 see how much you care about Julie, and she comes first. And

 it should be you up there playing with her and not me.

 So... I'm sorry. Thank you, Susan. How convenient that you decided this

 after I showed up without my guitar. Well, like I said, I'm

 sorry. I wish it could be you up there. You know, I

 play piano. And so let's all welcome Julie Mayer and her Aunt

 Edie. You did a good thing. Yeah. Well, I try. Gimme a

 break. This thing has like 90 flats in it. Poor Julie. Stop

 it. You're loving this. No. Not at all. Open up. So they

 said you needed to see me. What is it? What's going on?

 I've been thinking. You know, about... ...everything that happened with John. And...

 And... ...I was really selfish and stupid. And I'm sorry. I really

 am sorry. That's all I had to say, really. You know what?

 That is the best anniversary gift that you've ever given me. -

 Really? - Yeah. Actually, the one you gave me is really nice

 too. Everyone enjoys a game of make-believe now and then. Of course,

 the ways in which we play can vary greatly. Sometimes we tell

 ourselves work won't interfere with our family life. - Lynette, staff meeting.

 Now. - Yeah. Sometimes we imagine certain relationships to be more meaningful

 than they really are. Occasionally, we put on a show, as if

 to convince ourselves our secrets aren't really all that terrible. Yes, the

 game of make-believe is a simple one. Did you know Rex Van

 De Kamp? Yes. Did Mrs Van De Kamp ask you to poison

 her husband? No. Did you poison Rex Van De Kamp? You start

 by lying to yourself. No. And if you can get others to
