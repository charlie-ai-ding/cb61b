 ":"In

 therapy, the subject was Tom's new girlfriend. What about sex? Not yet.

 I... he wants to end the marriage. Susan wanted to quit... Maybe

 I'm not a real artist. This class has been really good for

 you. But decided to face the challenge instead. You're hiding something, and

 I'm gonna pull it out of you. There is a chance that

 you might actually become an artist. Carlos tried to drown his guilt...

 Carlos! Hey, Gaby. And Ben showed Bree the site where construction was

 about to begin. Have you ever been here before? Once. Sync by

 YYeTs.net Corrected by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com Paranoia... It's the irrational fear that someone

 is after you... That you're going to be exposed at any moment.

 Paranoia can sneak up on you... Causing you to stumble at every

 turn. And just when you think you're in the clear... And the

 danger has passed... Paranoia reminds you... Gaby? Lynette? That no place is

 truly safe. Oh, my God. Where'd he go? Is he gone? For

 now, but we gotta hurry. I think we're close. I recognize this

 area. God, this is creeping me out. Well, it doesn't help that

 it's Halloween. Let's just dig him up and get this over with.

 Ladies? Ladies! Bree? Bree? Honey? Are you okay? Paranoia-- it's the irrational

 fear that someone is after you. But even when you hope it

 isn't real, it can still scare you to death. No! Susan Delfino

 had always been a great student. That's because she knew how to

 be the teacher's pet. Some liked gifts. Some liked extra credit. And

 some just liked her. But in her new class, Susan would learn

 that not every teacher... Happy Halloween. Was in the market for a

 pet. I thought you might like a little treat complete with candy

 corn. Who doesn't like candy corn? Apparently you. It appears some of

 you have remembered today is the day I select my intern. Oh,

 is that today? I have a commission due Tuesday, and I need

 all the help I can get this weekend. Now this is obviously

 a prestigious honor. That goes without saying. And it won't be awarded

 based on brownnosing, bootlicking or cupcake making. That about covers all your

 moves. My decision will be made solely on talent, experience, and who

 irritates me the least. Oh, crap. And that's why-- Stand up, Amy.

 I've chosen... Susan Delfino. Sit down, Amy. That was fun. Me? Meet

 me at 5:00 tomorrow. We'll discuss your duties. Thank you so much.

 I-I'm so grateful. But could we make it 5:15? My son has

 soccer practice-- I have no kids. And he's not very good so

 he won't be going. See you at 5:00. Hey, babe. How you

 doing? Fine. Good. Great. Glad to hear it. Would you like your

 own cup? Sorry. Just... That night really scared the hell out of

 me. Scared me, too. Yeah, but you haven't done anything about it.

 I thought you were gonna check out an A.A. meeting. Gaby, I'm

 not an alcoholic. Tell that to the cab driver who helped me

 carry you inside the house. Fine. If it will keep your fingers

 out of my coffee, I'll go to a meeting. Thank you. I

 love you. We're gonna get through this, okay? Oh! And do me

 a favor. If it turns out you are an alcoholic, promise you

 won't be one of those whiny ones. Okay, we gotta talk. Oh,

 God, he brought Jane? Hey, sweetie. How was your dad's? It was

 fun. Good. Look. It's my Halloween costume. I'm gonna be a swan.

 Right. How about you be something mommy can actually make, like a

 ghost or a 13-year-old American teenager? You don't have to make it.

 Jane said she would. Of course she did. Well, I should go

 thank her for helping me to parent you. Jane, it's okay. You

 don't have to stay in the car. Or maybe you should. I

 mean, I don't wanna show you up with my fancy sweats. Oh,

 stop. You look great. Look, I think it's sweet that you volunteered

 to help Penny make her costume. Hey, I hope I didn't overstep.

 You know, it's just, before medical school, I dabbled a bit in

 fashion design. Of course you did. It's nothing. Couple of semesters in

 Paris. Ah, Paris. C'est la plus belle ville du monde, no? Oui.

 Oui, oui. Yes. She's-- she's teaching me. Of course she is. Anyway,

 making Penny's Halloween costume is sort of a... mother/daughter tradition. Since when?

 Since always. Actually, I started it already, and I don't want to

 oversell, but it's gonna be pretty great. I'm sorry. She didn't say

 anything. I'm sure she didn't want to hurt your feelings. Well, if

 you change your mind, it's really no trouble. I've already made a

 bunch of costumes for the kids in the cancer ward. Of course

 she did. Oh, God. You're closing the curtains. This can't be good.

 It isn't. I just heard the details of Ben's latest real estate

 project. Mom! Oh, honey, not right now. We're talking. You told me

 to try on my costume. You said you'd fix the yolk. Oh,

 this is will take two seconds. Celia's going as bacon. This works

 a lot better when we're together. So what were you guys talking

 about? Um, I was just telling your mother a very scary Halloween

 story about these four witches who buried a monster deep in the

 woods. Cool. And after they buried the monster, they went on with

 their lives until this big, frightening real estate developer came along and

 decided to build condos right where the monster was buried! Ow! Oh!

 Sorry, sorry. Are you sure? Yeah. Witches always lie. Not this witch.

 Ha. Well, I think one of those witches better go see what

 she can do to kill the project. How?! I don't know. It's

 your story. Fine. Yeah. That actually was kind of a lame story.

 It wasn't even scary. Trust me, honey. It is really, really scary.

 Hi. Sorry I've been A.W.O.L. for the past t two week, but,

 uh, that's only 'cause I-- I'm sorry. Have we met? Ben, is

 it? I know, I know. I... I've been swamped getting my new

 project under way. But I wanna make it up to you. How?

 Tomorrow night, my place, dinner for two, cooked by one. Tomorrow's Halloween.

 So? It'll be fun. We can, uh, pass out candy to trick-or-treaters.

 And then maybe later, we can... trick a little... treat of our...

 I don't know where I was going with that. All right, you

 want a date with me? Yeah. Beg. Excuse me? On your knees,

 soldier. Renee, dear, sweet, horrible girl, would you do me the honor

 of dining with me on the morrow? I would. Was that really

 necessary? It was for me. I had to make sure I wasn't

 rolling over for a guy with a bald spot. Intern Susan Delfino

 reporting for duty, sir. I was wondering how long it might take

 me to regret this. Wait. I just want to say how honored

 I am that you chose me. It's nice to know that when

 the history of art is written, there'll be one small footnote with

 my name on it. Susan, Jasper, Jasper, Susan. I'll pick him up

 Monday night. I don't understand. Well, he's my son. You're watching him

 for the weekend. My ex says he's deathly allergic to tree nuts,

 cats... And something else. I can't remember. Uh, wait a-- wait a

 minute. So... you have a son? Somebody married you? Briefly. I was

 young and needed money. She was rich and wanted a child, and

 now one weekend a month, Jasper and I spend some quality time

 together. See you Monday. Uh, wait a minute. Um, so... That's what

 this is. I'm just a... glorified babysitter. No, no, no, no. As

 per school policy, we're calling it an internship. That way, I don't

 have to pay you. So, Jasper, looks like it's just you and

 me. What are you reading? \"Tips for surviving a nuclear attack.\" The

 people of Nagasaki never saw it coming. I know how they feel.

 So Ben and I are having sex tomorrow. Ew. Not in front

 of my kid's costume. Sorry. It's our first time. It's kind of

 a big deal. First time? I thought sex was like shaking hands

 for you. It is. I like to get it over with early

 so there's no pressure. But with Ben, there's been all this buildup,

 so... Pressure? Yeah. I like him... a lot. And I want our

 first time to be great. That's sweet. That's why I got some

 sex drugs in Chinatown. Less sweet. \"Woman love fluid.\" I gotta put

 some tape over that. This stuff work? Even if it all it

 Jacks up is my confidence, that is good enough for me. Okay.

 What do you think? This looks like a cat, right? Sure, after

 it's passed through a coyote. What is going on? You always go

 for easy costumes. Didn't you once staple math tests to Penny's jeans

 and send her out as \"Smarty Pants\"? Yes, but this year, Tom's

 new girlfriend offered to make Penny's costume, so I, of course, said

 I would. Damn, why is there no Chinese costume fluid? Well, you're

 in luck. I have a friend in New York that is a

 costume designer, and he has three Tony awards. And he'll make my

 kid's cat outfit? Sadly, he'll do anything for cash. He's a huge

 cokehead. That means he'll do it fast, too. That's great! I-I mean,

 for us. Poor guy needs help. My thoughts and prayers are with

 him. Hey there. If you're, uh, here for the meeting, it just

 ended, as I'm sure you can tell by the massacre at the

 doughnut box. Actually, I was just... really looking to talk to somebody.

 Well, I'm Allen. Carlos. Why don't you tell me what's going on

 with you, Carlos? Come on in. Okay. All right. I, uh... had

 a little incident a few nights ago. Uh-huh. Got loaded... and I

 left the house, and, uh... I don't remember doing it. Uh-huh, you

 blacked out, huh? Yeah, I'm so jealous of you guys. Uh, I

 was always cursed with total recall of every horrifying second of my

 benders. So how often does this happen? It doesn't. I usually don't

 drink that much. Just lately. Yeah? Oh. So what's \"lately\"? I don't

 know. Two months, maybe. Something happen two months ago? You lose your

 job? Did your wife leave you? Dog die? No. Nothing I can

 think of. 'Cause usually this sort of thing is triggered by some

 kind of traumatic incident. You know, I don't think this was such

 a good idea. Hey, I wasn't trying to pry. Allen, thanks, but

 I really gotta be going. Was good meeting you, Carlos. Listen, if,

 uh, you ever wanna talk, here's my cell. Day or night, I'll

 pick up. Appreciate it. Good luck to you. Bree. What? Is everything

 all right? I just saw some miscreants throwing eggs at your house.

 I tried to run over and catch them, but I was too

 late. Ah, it's probably some kids warming up for Halloween. No, no,

 it wasn't kids, and they shouted something unpleasant about real estate developers,

 including an anti-Australian slur. Uh, I've never heard an anti-Australian slur. What

 was it? I'd rather not repeat it. The point is, there seems

 to be some strenuous opposition to the Chapman Woods development, and as

 your liaison, I think you should consider relocating it. All right. Let

 me consider it. Nah. Screw 'em. Excuse me? I already sunk $100,000

 into moving this project from Hawkins Lake, and there's... Well... what happened

 at Hawkins Lake? We were all set to go, bulldozers at the

 ready, and then the environmental impact study turns up five endangered yellow-spotted

 frogs. Frogs? Yeah. The slimy little bastards are now the proud owners

 of 50 acres of waterfront real estate. I'm just curious. Have you

 had your environmental impact study in Chapman Woods yet? Uh, tomorrow, but

 I'm not worried. My guys have been over every inch of it.

 Not a miserable amphibian in sight. Yes. And I can't imagine that

 would change overnight. A construction project for a frog? If it's an

 endangered yellow-spotted frog, they will. Now come on. Help me find some.

 Ugh. Things creep me out. You know that story where the princess

 has to kiss the frog, turn him back into a prince? So

 not worth it. I don't care how rich his dad was. Gaby,

 you know where they don't have frogs? Prison! Which is where we're

 gonna be if we don't plant some at Ben's construction site. Fine.

 I'll help. Oh. Saw one. Ohh! Oh, is that one? Does he

 have spots on his legs? He has to have spots on his

 legs. Well, you're good with crafts. You can stencil some on later.

 Aah! Ohh! Damn it! This is more of a boys thing. Why

 isn't Carlos here? Because I didn't tell him about the construction. What?

 Why not? Because he's got a lot on his plate right now.

 Or, actually, in his glass. He's been drinking a lot. Really? Do

 you want me to speak to him? No. No. He's been going

 to A.A. meetings. He said he met a great sponsor. He's doing

 fine. I certainly understand what he's going through. It's kind of a

 miracle that I've stayed sober through all of this. Don't move. There's

 one by your foot. Aah! This is gonna be a long day.

 So... you wanna play some video games? That's original. Okay. Um... Something

 more creative. You wanna carve a Jack-o'-Lantern? I'd rather stick a knife

 in my eye. Only 36 hours to go. 37. He's always late.

 I am the Candy-Bot 3000. Please give candy. Aw, M.J., you look

 amazing. I mean... I am Mom-Bot 3000. Costume approved. You guys sound

 stupid. Your insult does not compute. Shut up! Nobody cares about being

 a dumb robot! Hey, what's going on? I just hate all this

 Halloween stuff. How can you hate a holiday that's all about dressing

 up and getting free candy? It's the best day of the year.

 Jasper, does your dad not let you celebrate Halloween? He says it's

 for kids. You do know you're a kid, right? Okay, that's it.

 You and your father are coming trick-or-treating with us. He'll never go

 for that. Oh, you just let me talk to him. I can

 be pretty persuasive. I'd rather stick a knife in my eye. Oh,

 come on. Your son is dying to go trick-or-treating. It's just a

 couple hours. Until I deliver these paintings, it's the only thing I

 care about. That and a cigarette. Don't look at this. It's not

 done. Gaby, will you stop with the sanitizer? Your hands are gonna

 slide right off the wheel. I can't help it. I can still

 feel those slimy things crawling through my fingers. Speaking of which, how

 come I don't hear anything moving in that box? Shouldn't they be

 croaking or something? Maybe they're resting. Or dead. You don't think they're

 dead, do you? Oh, God! Don't bring that in the front seat.

 I don't hear anything. All right. I'm trying to remain calm. Please

 tell me those are your long-webbed fingers on my arm. Gaby, do

 not panic. Aah! Get it off! Stay calm! Stay calm! Don't panic!

 Watch the road! Oh, God! I think it's on my leg! Stop

 swerving! I'm trying to get the lid back on! Get it off

 me! Careful! It's crawling under the brake pedal! Not anymore! Oh, they're

 getting away! They're so fast! What the hell could endanger them?! Ohh!

 Detailing is never gonna get that out! We're so screwed. Will you

 please stop saying that? In 12 hours, those bulldozers are gonna break

 ground. I think the phrase \"we are so screwed\" cannot be said

 enough. There must be something we can do. They're gonna find Alejandro's

 body. They'll--they'll do an investigation. They'll learn he's my stepfather. Unless... Unless

 what? There's no body to be found. Mom, I need my cat

 costume. Dad and Jane will be here soon. I'm just putting on

 the finishing touches. The tracking number is jhkwrxa. I'm not sure why

 the tracking numbers are all letters, but it's your system, so-- Oh,

 forget it, forget it. There he is. Hey! Psst! Up here! Up

 here! Don't--don't ring the doorbell. I just put my baby down for

 a nap. Toss the package up here. I'll catch it. I have

 three sons. Come on! Nice. I can't wait any longer. Let me

 see. Mm! Finished. All yours. Thanks, mom. I can't believe you made

 this all by yourself. Mrs. Scavo! I need a signature! Let's go

 try it on. Come on. Okay. Go, go. I'm just saying you

 are one good wig away from being a fantastic cowardly lion. Drop

 it, witch. Just say it for me once. \"I do believe in

 spooks. I do, I do, I do believe in spooks.\" Look, I'm

 only here because you kidnapped my painting. The ransom was two hours

 of trick-or-treating, no costume, no chitchat. All I'm doing is counting the

 minutes till I can get back to work. Score. Check it out.

 They had giant peanut butter cups. Nice going, sweetie. I got a

 chocolate bomb. You want some? No, thanks, pal. What I want is

 to go. But we've only done half the street. Okay, well, tell

 you what. What if we leave now, and I'll give you 20

 bucks? You can buy all the candy you like. Your father's just

 messing with you. Run on ahead. I promise I'll go fast, Andre.

 He calls you \"Andre\"? Oh, yeah, I prefer it. \"Dad\" isn't an

 accurate characterization of our relationship. He's your son. He's her son. Biologically,

 he's yours. Ontologically, he's getting in the way of my work. Well,

 psychologically, you're a freakin' sociopath. Do you see how desperately that boy

 is trying to connect with you? And you do everything you can

 to push him away. I'm not interested in the relationship. Tough. I

 mean, he's not a novel you can just toss aside if it's

 boring. Or a painting you just walk past 'cause it's not interesting.

 He's a person with feelings. Okay, just keep going. This is really

 making the time fly by. I have spent the last few weeks

 trying to get you to like me, and I just realized something.

 I don't like you. Your painting is in the utility closet next

 to your classroom. Go take care of your masterpiece. I'll take care

 of your son. Hi. Thank you for letting me tag along trick-or-treating.

 Chloe's 20 now, so I'm nostalgic for things like this. Aw, you're

 lucky. My older kids are 20 as well, but this one kept

 knocking me up so now I won't get to be nostalgic until

 I'm 90. So... is Penny ready? 'Cause we gotta get to the

 McAllisters' before they run out of popcorn balls. She's just putting on

 her costume... That I sewed with my hands, and I'm pretty proud

 of it. Mom! This is amazing. Look. I'm a kitten with a

 whip. Meow. This is just in case she's attacked by dogs. You're

 proud of this? Yep. I thought it was cute. Yeah, if she's

 trick-or-treating for dollar bills! It's completely inappropriate! Honey, go back upstairs and

 see if you can find those \"Smarty Pants.\" Do I have to?

 Penny, are you sure you put the whole costume on? I think

 so. There wasn't a skirt that went with it? 'Cause I'm pretty

 sure a skirt was a part of that pattern. Right? Yeah, yeah.

 There was. Well, I'd bet I could help you find that skirt

 your mom made. I bet you could. Go on. Trick or treat?!

 Hold that thought. Trick or treat?! What amazing costumes. Now don't get

 me with your hook. And look at you. Aren't you the prettiest

 little princess in the whole... world... Uh... Now... let's see if we

 can find something \"fun size\" for me to enjoy. Whoa! Is it,

 uh... Is it hot in here? Uh... don't think so. Okay. Maybe

 I should, uh, take off a layer. Mmm. You all right? I'm

 not sure. I've got this... this tightness in my throat. Yeah, and

 your eyes look a little glassy. Uh, you sure you're okay? We

 can do this another night, you know. No, no, no. I'm fine,

 really. Now... get over here, big man. What about the house with

 the spiderwebs and the bats? That didn't scare you? Nah, it takes

 a lot more than that to scare me. Aah! How did you

 get in here? This was under the mat. It's a great hiding

 place, by the way. Had me stumped for a good four seconds.

 Mommy? Can we go trade candy? Well, you'll have to ask Jasper's...

 Andre. Yeah, it's fine. All right. Yeah. Thought you were gonna finish

 your painting. I will. But I was thinking about what you said.

 And you realized the error of your ways and came to tell

 me that? God. Is that how things work in your world? Look,

 I get you don't like me. Most people don't. I've learned to

 live with that mainly by not caring. Oh. I think you care.

 I swear to God I don't. You have to understand, Susan. My

 work is always gonna come first. Even before Jasper? That's what I

 was getting to. I heard what you said. He is my son.

 And I'm gonna try to be a better dad. Well, I bet

 it'll make you a better painter. I bet it won't. You need

 to know something about being a true artist. This--this gift, this curse,

 whatever it is-- it consumes you and blots out everything else-- friends,

 family, everything. I would never let that happen to me. You may

 not have a choice. Trick or... That's weird. They didn't even wait

 for the candy. How's dinner coming? Oh, it's just about r-- Oh,

 my God. What happened to you? What? You need to see a

 doctor. Oh. Over this little rash? Don't be silly. I'm not moving.

 Oh, that's not good. You know, o-on second thought, I'm not really

 feeling very... Oh, okay. Okay. Definitely time for a doctor. Almost finished.

 Wow, from cathouse to house cat in ten minutes. You could do

 this professionally. You mean like the person who made it? Yeah. I

 may have... slightly overexaggerated my sewing skills. I guess... I was feeling...

 This is new for me. It's new for me, too. You gonna

 bust me? For trying to look good? Lynette, when my husband left

 me for our Swedish au pair, I went out and bought my

 daughter a car. She was 13. Well, then it's official. You're better

 at everything, even bribery. Please. You had a career and raised five

 kids. I could barely keep it together with one. Who says I

 kept it together? I think you're doing pretty great. You're smart, confident.

 In fact, this might sound a little weird, but... you seem like

 the kind of person I could be friends with. It doesn't sound

 weird. Before, when you saved my ass out there, that was the

 kind of thing a friend does. Happy to help. Then... can I

 ask you to help me with something else? Sure. You think maybe

 you could stop trying to take my husband away from me? What?

 Your marriage ended. Whoa. Whoa. That's not fair. The circumstances were completely

 different. Maybe they were. But you still know how it hurts. So

 I'm asking you, please, back off. Okay? You think I'm gonna give

 up on him just because you can't accept your marriage is over?

 We have five kids. One of them is just a baby. I'm

 not letting my husband go without a fight. Well, according to Tom,

 you're always looking for a fight. My ex was like that, too.

 You know, and when you find somebody who isn't, you wanna hang

 on to them. You should give this to Penny. Okay, the girls

 are asleep. Listen for the doorbell in case there are some late

 trick-or-treaters. I know the drill. Oh, and don't wait up for me.

 I'll be late. We're taking Lynette out for a drink. Oh. Sorry.

 I'm fine, Gaby. It's just her first holiday without Tom and the

 kids, so we wanna give her a fun night out, you know,

 to boost her spirits. Bye. We're digging up the body tonight? We

 have no choice. Ben's bulldozers start tearing up the woods tomorrow morning.

 Where are Carlos and Susan? Carlos is not in a good place

 right now. I didn't wanna freak him out. And Susan has done

 nothing but freak out, so it's just us. Come on. Oh. Okay.

 I... I can't believe this. We're getting rid of a dead body

 again. I know. I'm so sorry. No, I just spent the evening

 with my husband's new girlfriend. This doesn't sound so bad. How you

 feeling? Better. They gave me a shot of cortisone. The doctor said

 it was something I ate. Maybe strawberries or nuts. Really? Uh, he

 told me it was the woman love fluid. Okay. Good-bye. Nice knowing

 you. I mean, you do know you're not supposed to roofie yourself,

 right? Go away. Well, I don't get it. Now why would you

 take something like that? Because... I wanted tonight to be special, okay?

 And... Because I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. You... When

 I moved here, you offered me sex before you even knew my

 name. Well, yeah, but that was before... Can I put the sheet

 back on? Mm. That was before I realized how much I like

 you. Well, I like you, too. Uh, would you like some, uh,

 company under there? ♪ Trick or treat? ♪ ♪ Trick or treat?

 ♪ Uh, so this is the part where you give me candy.

 I don't know about this. What ever happened to \"never return to

 the scene of the crime\"? She's got a point. We just need

 to do this in the most efficient manner possible-- find the grave,

 dig up the body... Sounds easy so far. Wrap it in a

 tarp, weight it down with some bricks and toss it in the

 lake. I have all the supplies in my trunk, along with clean

 towels, hand sanitizer, and breathing masks in case the stench is overwhelming.

 Anyone wanna guess what a corpse looks like after two months in

 the ground? Ohh. Oh, yeah. Is it just bones, or is there,

 like, other stuff, too? Ugh. Hey! Shh! Did you hear something? Yeah.

 What is that? Hey! Who's there? Who is that?! I don't know.

 What do we do? Run. Okay! No! Split up. Aah! Where'd he

 go? Is he gone? For now, but we gotta hurry. I-I think

 we're close. I recognize this area. Oh, God, this is creeping me

 out. Well, it doesn't help that it's Halloween. Let's just dig him

 up and get this over with. Okay. Gaby? Lynette? Oh, my God.

 Ladies? Ladies! Bree? Paranoia... It's the irrational feeling that the whole world

 is against you. No. But it's no longer paranoia when you discover...

 that someone really is out to get you. Sync by YYeTs.net Corrected
