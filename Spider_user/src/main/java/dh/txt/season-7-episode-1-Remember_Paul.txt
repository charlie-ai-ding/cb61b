 ":"Previously

 on... Ten years ago, Carlos' mother died after being hit by a

 car that Andrew was driving. Orson packed his bags... You are not

 the woman I thought you were. He's my son. I had no

 choice. And I no longer choose to be your husband. And Bree

 decided to come clean. There's something I need to tell you... It's

 the kind of thing that could end our friendship. A dying nurse

 made a confession... The people who run this hospital need to know

 what I did. How do you tell parents the child they've been

 raising isn't really theirs? Financial worries drove Susan to a big decision...

 - You can't sell your house. - We're not selling. We're renting.

 Which led to the return of a long-lost neighbor. The truth is,

 I used to live here. Oh, then I guess everyone will be

 surprised to see you again. They absolutely will. There was a time

 when my husband and I were very happy. I remember warm summer

 afternoons and backyard barbecues and laughter with friends. Our life was like

 some kind of suburban dream. But the day comes when we all

 must wake up. For me, that day came when a letter arrived.

 As threats go, it was concise and to the point. I did

 what I had to to protect my family. My husband found out

 who wrote the letter. He let her know how much this upset

 him. Her sister figured out what my husband had done. So she

 decided to frame him for murder... Her murder, to be more specific.

 And that's when the dream that was Paul Young's life became a

 nightmare. Years later, a woman was pulled over for speeding. This woman

 had no identification, so she was arrested. And that is how people

 learned that Felicia Tillman was very much alive. I see you got

 the suit I sent over. You like it? I like anything that's

 not orange. Well, get ready to do all sorts of shopping. Your

 settlement check came in. So where are you going first? After all

 these years in prison, I bet you're ready to party. All I

 want is to go home. What, to your old neighborhood? You sound

 surprised. Well, none of your neighbors supported you during the trial. They

 didn't visit while you were here. No one would blame you if

 you hated them a little. Oh, I don't hate them... a little.

 And so my husband returned to Wisteria Lane. The neighbors were surprised

 to see him. They hadn't thought about Paul Young in years. But

 he had thought about them. And he was going to make sure

 they'd never forget him... again. The phone call that comes in the

 middle of the night... The letter that arrives by special courier... The

 e-mail marked \"urgent!\"... Yes, there are all sorts of ways bad news

 can be delivered. But some news is so bad... it must be

 delivered in person. Why do I have to tell them? You said

 this couple lives in your neighborhood. Trustees of the hospital feel that

 makes you uniquely qualified. And just what am I supposed to say?

 \"Great block party.\" \"By the way, one of our nurses\" \"may have

 switched your baby at birth. Try the dip.\" Every minute we wait,

 this hospital takes on more liability. Now get on over to... Wisteria

 Lane and tell those people what's going on. I don't know how

 I'm gonna do this. There's only one way to deliver news like

 this... remain as calm as possible. Bree! Get out here! Damn it!

 Why is nobody home? Lorna, Gwen... Oh, thank God. Well, hi, Karen.

 What's wrong? Paul Young... he's back. What? You heard me. Now don't

 just stand there. - We gotta warn people. - Come on. Bree,

 I've never seen you like this. Are you all right? I have

 something horrible to tell you, and I don't know how to say

 it. Well, you better think of somethin'. You're starting to freak me

 out. Remember that night when Carlos' mother was run over by a

 car? Well, I know who did it. You what? It was Andrew.

 Oh, God! He was only 16. I was afraid he was gonna

 go to jail... - Ohh! - So Rex and I decided to

 cover it up. Oh, this is... this is bad. This is really

 bad. I need to go throw up a little. Oh, I am

 so sorry. And I realize I should have told you sooner. No!

 No, no, no, you shouldn't have told me at all! - What?

 - Now I have to tell Carlos, and he's going to kill

 Andrew, and then he's going to have to go to prison, so

 thank you for sending my husband to prison, Bree. - Nice work!

 - I just couldn't live with the secret any longer, and when

 Orson found out, - he told me I was a horrible person.

 - That's why you told me? Oh, please, we're all horrible people!

 You see this? It's yours. They delivered it here. I kept it.

 Horrible! Just so you know, Orson was so disgusted, he's divorcing me.

 Normally, I'd give you a hug, - but right now I sorta

 don't give a crap! - Again, very sorry. God! How am I

 gonna tell Carlos? He is gonna be so angry! And he'll probably

 find a way to blame me! You'll never guess who's back! Mom,

 we don't have any clean plates. Didn't you run the dishwasher? We're

 also out of milk. You gotta go to the store. And the

 dry cleaners while you're at it. Okay, everybody. Look at your hands.

 Come on. Mm-hmm. Anyone not holding a baby, you're on your own.

 You can wash and shop and clean for yourselves. My days of

 being the perfect mom are over. When were those days, exactly? It's

 my uterus that's worn out, not my hearing. So you're not gonna

 help with anything? - 'Cause this place is really starting to go

 to hell. - Baby number five. An entire basketball team has come

 out of me, so I'm officially too exhausted to care. You know,

 the good moms enjoy doing stuff for their families. Hello? That's your

 brother Preston. He's about to be beaten. Yes, he is. Yes, he

 is. Mom, it's Renee Perry. Hey, Renee! - Who's Renee Perry? -

 Oh, she's your mom's friend from college. She's married to Doug Perry,

 who plays for the Yankees. - And she's really rich. - How

 rich? Every few years, Renee flies mom to New York - for

 a big, fancy weekend. - And mom always comes back in a

 great mood. So this might be perfect timing. Damn it to hell.

 She's coming here. Wh-when? Tomorrow. Why? I don't know, but that is

 something we can talk about while we turn this dump into an

 actual home. Okay, people, move, move, move. Let's go! Come on. Hey,

 you, too, Tom. I'm holding the baby. Well, spray her with some

 glass cleaner and rub her on the windows. I don't want Renee

 to know I live like this. But, mom, if she's your friend,

 - won't she like you no matter how you live? - She's

 not that kind of friend. You're never gonna believe who's back. Here

 we are. Home sweet... Home. So... what do you think, buddy? This

 is where we're gonna live? Yeah. So are we poor? If you

 field this one, I'll tell him where babies come from. No, honey,

 we're not poor. We're just... lower middle class. Poor people wish they

 could live like this. They shouldn't. Oh, sweetie. I know this isn't

 what we're used to. Buddy, we're not gonna lie to you. Money

 is a little tighter than before, but that's why we're here... So

 we can save up and get back to our house. And it's

 not gonna take that long. Your daddy's taking on extra jobs, and

 I'm still teaching, and I'm gonna start selling that really cool jewelry

 I've been making. Oh, god. Sweetie, it's gonna be okay. And as

 long as we're together, we can survive this. - Hello? - Susan!

 Hi, Mrs. McCluskey. What's up? - You'll never believe this. Paul Young

 is back. - What?! Where is he? Where do you think? He's

 in the house you rented to him. I didn't know. Lee just

 told me it was a guy. You didn't even ask for his

 name? He paid in advance, and he didn't have pets. I didn't

 care. How is Paul even out of jail? That maniac was serving

 a life sentence. Hello, ladies. If you'd like to come in for

 a while, I'll tell you the story. Come on now. It's a

 good one. Felicia Tillman's alive? Why are you so surprised? I said

 that over and over again in my trial. Oh, wait. That's right.

 None of you could make it to the courthouse. Look, Paul... It's

 okay. You were busy. I get it. I told myself I'd explain

 how I was framed when you came to visit me in prison.

 Oh, wait... We're so sorry. In our defense, we thought you were

 a cold-blooded killer. What you endured over the last ten years... I

 can't even imagine it. No, you can't. But the good news is,

 I'm back. Yeah, about that, um, why did you wanna come back

 here? Well, why do you think? I missed my friends. Innocent or

 not, that guy still gives me the creeps. I can't believe Paul

 Young is back on Wisteria Lane. And he's using my shower. Jack!

 You here for your 9 iron? Damn, I thought if I shaved,

 you'd wouldn't recognize me and I could keep it. Actually, I need

 to talk to you and your wife. Hey, Gaby! In a minute!

 You look a little pale, buddy. Something wrong? I think we should

 wait for Gaby. Jack, what's going on here, man? You're making me

 nervous. Let's just go inside, hmm? No! This is impossible. We still

 have the bracelet they put around Juanita's ankle in the hospital. Theresa

 Pruitt was the nurse in charge of those bracelets, and although the

 hospital did not know this at the time, she had a drinking

 problem. And eight years later, you're telling me this. I've spent eight

 years loving someone else's daughter! Again, I wanna stress that the hospital

 only belatedly became... Jack, I swear to God, if you go lawyer

 on me, I will put your head through a wall! So where

 is our... Biologi... God, I don't even know what to call her.

 We haven't been able to track the family down yet. Then we're

 not telling Gaby, not till you find this other girl. Carlos, I

 have a legal responsibility here. She has to be told. Fine! I'll

 do it. But I don't know how. This is going to destroy

 her. Nope. I was wrong. Preston, switch back with Parker. - Why

 are we doing this? - When Renee pulls up to this house,

 she is gonna see the one thing I can show off... My

 beautiful, beautiful family. What is that, a pimple? Get in the back!

 Honey, don't you think you're getting a little carried away? Tom, that

 woman lives in a penthouse. We had to give up meat so

 we could buy a laptop. - Let me have this. - Is

 that her? Of course it is. Okay, everybody, smile for mom and

 her strange and twisted friendship. Oh! Hi! I'm back, Rudolfo. Please tell

 signor Cipriani I always stay in that suite when I visit Venice,

 and if it's not available, I'll be very unhappy. Now if you'll

 excuse me, there's someone more important I need to speak with. Hi!

 Hey, Jose. Thanks for holding. Look, I can't do Thursday. So... Jose,

 she'll call you back. Lynette, you haven't changed. Neither have you. Hi,

 sweetie. Oh, no, please tell me you didn't dump Tom for this

 handsome, young trophy husband. It's me, Renee. I mean, I do work

 out, like, three times a week, so maybe that's what you're... Oh,

 okay. - Are these your kids? - Yeah. Yes, and here is

 our latest addition. Oh, she's precious. Look at you all... What a

 perfect little suburban picture. Well, you know, I've been blessed. Very blessed.

 I'm sorry I gotta run, Renee, but I'm late for work. Work?

 And I thought you wore that sexy tie just for me. You

 like it? They... they say that bolder colors are coming back, so

 I thought I'd... Okay. Bye. Bye. Love you. Oh, I gotta say,

 Lynette, this place is adorable. It's so... cozy and intimate and... Pay

 attention, kids. You're learning a lot of new words for \"small.\" Oh,

 that's not what I meant. I hate banging around my lonely old

 barn of a house. Sometimes weeks go by without me running into

 a servant. I'm sure you see them on whipping day. Lynette, why

 so mean? I worked on these compliments all the way from the

 airport. Drive slower next time. Mom. It's all right. We're just old

 friends reconnecting. And I'm being sincere. This is the way to go...

 Stripped down to the bare essentials. You know, more people should live

 like this. Most people do live like this. When you're flying in

 your private jet, and you look down and go, \"wow, they look

 like ants down there,\" we're the ants. So you have a private

 jet? Well, it's not just ours. We share it with the team.

 Wait. So you get to hang out with the Yankees? - That's

 awesome. - How is Doug, by the way? Oh, he's fine, but

 all that stuff... The team, the jet, the money... It's like a

 fantasy world. This is what I yearn for. This is real. This

 is... sticky. So you're staying in a really fancy hotel? Well, I

 came straight from the airport, so I haven't booked a hotel yet.

 Oh, why don't you stay with us? Oh, I'm sure Renee wouldn't

 want... I would love to. Are you sure? 'Cause, you know, five

 kids... It gets stickier. Oh, I don't mind. It'd be fun. I've

 got a lot of catching up to do with my old, old

 friend. By the way, I have a doctor who can get rid

 of one of those \"olds.\" All right. Well, I guess I can

 set you up on the sleeper sofa. Sleeper sofa? Ooh. Look at

 me. I'm one of the ants. Hi. You own the building, right?

 I'm Susan Delfino. My husband Mike and I are in 1b. Jiggle

 the handle. The toilet's fine. Oh, no, no, no. I'm just dropping

 off the security deposit. Sorry it's late. We've been having some money

 problems. Have you? Well, I'm Maxine. Come on in. I'll make you

 some tea. - Thanks. - Come on. That is such a shame

 about Mike's business. And here you are, with no skills, trying to

 make ends meet. - Mm. Oh, I have skills. I make my

 own jewelry. I made this. Can you believe it? I really can.

 You know, I remember when my husband Sidney passed away. His illness

 took every dime we had. And I didn't know what I was

 gonna do. Well, it looks like you did okay. I mean, you

 own the building. Yeah, well, that's because I stopped pouting. I got

 off my tuchis, and I started my own business. And now I'm

 able to help other struggling women. You know, they set their own

 hours. They work from their own homes. And oh, yoy, yoy, the

 money. That sounds like a dream job. I'll bet you'd be real

 good at it. Let me show you. Are there phones involved? I've

 been told I have an excellent phone voice. Uh, \"hello. Can I

 interest you in a...\" Oh, my God. It's my web site! I

 got a 10-unit Mac pro server farm and a 1.5-Meg t1 line.

 You run a porn site? You're trying to lure me into pornography?

 Oh, my God! Did you slip something into my tea? Honey, relax.

 This is strictly P.G.... Women doing housework in lingerie, no nudity, no

 sex. So? What do you say? What do I say? I say...

 shame! Shame on you! These are nice, respectable girls just like you.

 Deirdre's going to night school to become a nurse, and Martha's trying

 to start over after a divorce. Don't they worry about people they

 know seeing them? Most of our clients are overseas... You know, Europe,

 Asia. So if you go to Kuala Lumpur, wear a hat. Come

 on. You said you had money problems. Here's what Martha makes in

 a week. Unto Martha for selling her dignity to the highest bidder.

 I promise, you won't do anything I wouldn't let my own daughter

 do! Look for yourself! She's on camera three! What are you looking

 at? Just some family photos. That's you the day you were born.

 Daddy? Who's that? That's your grandma. I wish I had met her.

 You would've loved her. Do you think about her a lot? Every

 day. She was the light of my life, and that's why we

 named you after her, because I could not imagine a world without

 a Juanita Solis in it. Do you want me to tuck her

 in? No, I'll do it. Come on. Amy and I want to

 go to the mall tomorrow. Oh, sorry, honey. I have plans. I

 could ride my bike. By yourself? I don't think so. Why not?

 You're too young. That's why not. You're mean. Well, sometimes I have

 to be mean 'cause it's my job to protect you. What if

 you got hit by a bus? That's not gonna happen. Well, I

 can't take that chance. You are my whole world. If something happened

 to you, it would ruined my life. You understand that? Well, that's

 the last of it. I'll put these books in the car. Pleasure

 meeting you, Bree. Nice of your physical therapist to help with the

 move. So are you gonna be okay? Let's see. Uh, I'm getting

 a divorce. I lost my business, and I'm sitting here trying to

 remember why I quit drinking. I've had better Mondays. I'm sorry. Don't

 be. It's for the best. We haven't been happy for a long

 time. You know what you need? A project. No. That's what I

 always do... Distract myself with meaningless busywork as a way of avoiding

 my... emotions. I think I need to sit quietly and think about

 what I'm gonna do with my life. Well, whatever you do... I

 know it'll be spectacular. Good-bye, Bree. Hi, Bree. I've been thinking about

 our conversation last night. I just wanted to see how you were

 doing. I'm fine. In fact, I took your advice. I found myself

 a project. I'm surprised you agreed to see me. I wanted to

 spit in your face. I didn't realize there'd be glass. That's right.

 You're not used to prison. Give yourself time. What is it now...

 two to five years? 18 months with good behavior. You're giving me

 a lot of reasons to be extremely well behaved. Maybe I can

 give you a few pointers on prison life. I've become a bit

 of an expert thanks to you. Hey, here's one. It never hurts

 to tip the guard does your cavity search. Listen to me, you

 son of a bitch. I don't care what I have to do.

 I will see you behind bars again, or dead... Whichever is easier.

 Here's another pointer. They always record the conversations, so be careful about

 threatening the man you framed. You murdered my sister. That's a crazy,

 groundless accusation. I have to go now. I have things to do

 like shopping and walking around in the open air without a care

 in the world. You know you did it. I did. Wow, they're

 all so... big. Exactly. Thank you. - You're welcome? - Oh, I

 knew you guys would get it, unlike those idiots that walked by

 my card table in the park. It's not jewelry. It's wearable art.

 So... who wants to try these earrings? Oh, uh, I'm not sure

 that my delicate ears can support something so large. How about Gaby?

 She has big, strong, latino ears. Lynette, where is this friend of

 yours? We're all dying to meet her. Come on. I need a

 volunteer. Lynette? Yes! Yes! How's it feel? About as good as it

 looks, I'm guessing. I'll take 'em. Yes! What are you guys getting?

 I'm gonna buy this... for Bree and her strong, protestant neck. Oh,

 you guys are the best. Oh, hey, here she is. Okay, Susan,

 Bree, Gaby, this is my old college roommate, Renee. Hi. It is

 so nice to finally meet you. Lynette has talked so much about

 her friend from college. Oh, yes, you know how in school the

 pretty girls always hang out together? Well, I refused to go along

 with that. Renee comes off a little stuck up when you first

 meet her, which is a real time-saver. Sit down! So, Renee, you

 have to tell us. What was Lynette like in college? Uh, absolutely

 fearless. She just kept wearing those parachute pants, lesbian rumors be damned.

 Yes, Renee was always the one with the fashion sense. Before I

 met her, I'd never even heard of Gucci or Prada... or chlamydia.

 Wow, you guys play rough. No, it's just what we do. It's

 fun. I tease her about being all botulism from the nose up...

 And I tease her about being all cottage cheese from the waist

 down. So, Renee, we hear that you're married to Doug Perry? The

 baseball player? No surprise there. In our sorority, Renee was voted most

 likely to marry well. And Lynette was voted most likely to succeed.

 So, Bree, I hear you're an amazing cook. Hang on a second.

 What was that? What? That... \"Aw.\" Oh, nothing. I just didn't wanna...

 make you feel bad. About what? Well, it... it's just that, uh,

 I think our college friends would be surprised to see how you

 ended up. Oh, I thought they were still playing. You know, Renee,

 I have had a career and raised a family. And that's great.

 It's just that we had such high hopes for you. - Instead

 in spending the last fifteen years sponging off a rich guy. -

 Hey, let's stop before somebody gets hurt. Whatever I got, I got

 on my own. And what have you got? A blouse from the

 \"I've stopped trying\" collection and a pair of earrings your kid made

 at camp? And... somebody got hurt. That's great. Easy shots. You got

 more money than me. Oh, it's not about the money. The Lynette

 I knew never would have settled for this. You were adventurous. You

 backpacked through Croatia. You jumped onstage at a Springsteen concert. It's just

 hard for me to reconcile this suburban housewife with the girl... who

 had a threesome with two of the guys from the rugby team.

 Why would she do this? Why would she jump in a private

 jet and fly all the way across the country just to dump

 on my life? - Two guys, huh? - We're not talking about

 that anymore. I mean, isn't her life perfect enough? Does she really

 need to score bonus points by taking me down? So was it

 one rugby guy and then the other, or just sort of a-a

 scrum? Oh, drop it, Tom. You know, I have shielded you from

 some of the wilder things that I've done, like that time at

 the amusement park... Little story I like to call \"'d' cups on

 the teacups.\" Okay, I'm dropping it now. Thank you. Why are you

 getting so upset? I mean, I thought you and Renee loved to

 zing each other. Those weren't zings. When she made that... \"aw,\" she

 meant it. I mean, what the hell was that? She doesn't get

 to be disappointed in my life. Well, maybe you should tell her

 how you feel. Yeah. You're right. You're right. In fact, I am

 going to tell her a lot more than that. Good for you.

 But when you get back, I'd like to revisit a certain request

 I made on my 40th birthday, which, in light of recent revelations,

 seems a lot more... Okay. What's this? Yellow pages. Hotel is under

 \"h.\" Yeah, I had a feeling I hit a nerve this afternoon.

 If you find my life that pathetic, I'm going to spare you

 the agony of observing it. And by the way, taxi is under

 \"t.\" Lynette, I don't think your life is pathetic. Maybe not, but

 you clearly think yours is a whole lot better. So if you

 need me to say it, I'll say it. You win. You got

 the fabulous clothes, the penthouse apartment, and the rich husband. Congratulations. Doug

 is leaving me. I found out he was cheating... with his agent's

 assistant. I confronted him, told him it was her or me, and

 he chose her. I threw some things in a bag and took

 off. I didn't have a plan. I just needed to get out

 of there, and I couldn't think of anywhere else to go. Why

 didn't you tell me this? Lynette, my life is about to fall

 apart. I haven't even admitted it to myself yet. How could I

 tell you? Well, of course you can stay here as long as

 you want. Thanks. And to show my appreciation, I would like to

 pay for your first face-lift. That is so generous. Although now you've

 had nine, you probably get the next one free. Hey, Carlos. What

 can I... I'll make this quick. I'm gonna give you two options.

 Option one... I sue this hospital for... I don't know... $10 million,

 $20 million, - and I think I'll get it. - That would

 bankrupt us. - Then you're probably gonna wanna go for option two.

 - Which is? You make this whole thing go away... Shred the

 documents, call off the search for the other family, and never, ever

 let Gaby find out about this. Carlos, we've sent out letters, hired

 investigators. I don't know if this process can be stopped. - Try!

 - And even if it could, this is a hell of a

 thing you're taking about, keeping this secret by yourself. What's my choice?

 If Gaby knew the truth, it will kill her. No. I can't

 tell her. - I can't tell him. - Are you sure? Doesn't

 he deserve to know what Andrew did to his mother? You have

 to understand... Carlos is so happy right now. Our marriage is the

 best it's ever been. He loves his job. The girls are turning

 out so beautifully. Except for this one easily ignorable blip... Our life

 is perfect. And I won't let anything change that. Pork chops for

 dinner. I know it was a bit of a splurge, but I

 made up for it... 1-ply toilet paper. Something wrong? The bank turned

 down my loan application. Without that money, I can't hire any help.

 And without help, it's just gonna be one dinky job after another.

 We'll never get outta here like that. Okay. Well, we'll scrimp and

 save. I won't buy pork chops anymore. I'm gonna return these. I'm

 thinking about taking a job in Alaska. What? A buddy told me

 about it... six months on an oil rig. One year at the

 most. I could make triple what I can earn here. You can

 probably move back in the house before I'm even done. Mike, that

 is really dangerous work. M.J. needs you here. I need you here.

 No, there's gotta be another way. You think I wanna go? We

 don't have any good options here. Give me a month before you

 make a decision. I've just got a feeling that this jewelry thing

 of mine could start pulling in some serious money. Sweetheart, you're talented,

 but \"serious money\"? You'd be surprised what some people are willing to

 pay for. No nudity, no sex, and no one can ever know.

 I am so glad I can help. So what did you remove

 this with... a puma? I was anxious to get rid of it.

 My soon-to-be ex-husband picked out most of the decor, and I realized

 I needed a fresh start. You know, wallpaper's nice, but it's a

 little... Well, it's your house, not mine. No, Keith, please. I hired

 you. I wanna hear your ideas. I would suggest that you paint

 this room something, you know, bold. Oh, I like the sound of

 that. Perhaps a nice, deep beige. Or... bolder. I mean, with the

 size of this room and the light, you could go... scarlet red.

 Please don't take this the wrong way, but I'm going to be

 serving dinner in this room, not sailors. Could you excuse me for

 a moment? I'll be right back. Here you go... The final division

 of assets. Just need a Jill Hancock from you, and we're all

 set. Uh, before I forget, Andrew's having a dinner party on the

 10th, and he'd love for you to come. Even though we're separating,

 we both want you to feel that you're still part of the

 family. I'm touched. Thank you, Bree. Orson, don't we have plans? The

 wine tasting? Why don't you wait for me in the van? As

 you may have gleaned, my relationship with Judy has... evolved. Was it

 evolving while you and I were still together? No, no, of course

 not. Apparently, she had feelings for me, but she waited a respectable

 amount of time - before expressing them. - It's been a week.

 You know the expression \"the ink's not even dry\"? It's not dry!

 We have separated, Bree. And the two of us spent so many

 years being miserable. I just think at our age, we can't let

 an opportunity for happiness pass us by. Forget the red. I've got

 something here called moonstruck yellow that will kick your dining room's ass.

 Come on. I promise. You'll love this. With your red hair, you

 will look so hot in this room. But, you know, whatever you

 want. Clearly you have other options. Maybe I do. There's my favorite

 realtor. Thanks for coming over. How are ya? Bit of a pariah,

 thanks to you. Don't tell me the neighbors are blaming you for

 my return. Of course they are. You know, when you told me

 that you didn't have any pets, you could have mentioned - it's

 because they don't allow them in prison. - Now, now, be nice.

 - I'm about to throw more business your way. - Oh? I

 hear that my old house is back on the market. I'd like

 to buy it. Because of all the wonderful memories? Just find out

 what they're asking. Okay, but you just signed a one-year lease on

 this place, and you're buying a house across the street. Doesn't sound

 like a very good plan. Oh, believe me. I've had ten years

 to work on this plan. It's a good one. Bad news travels

 quickly, and when it arrives, we have to find a way to

 deal with it. If our husbands tell us they've moved on... we

 look for projects to distract us. If the bills start to stack

 up... we find ways to earn extra cash. If we're told a

 secret too terrible to share... we learn to keep it to ourselves.

 But we must remember the bad news that's delivered can sometimes be

 good news... in disguise. That the guy you were talkin' about? The

 one that killed your sister? It certainly is. He looks like a

 killer. It's a shame they let him out. As it turns out,

 it's all for the best. Paul can now receive the punishment he's

 entitled to. What do you mean? Just between us girls, Paul Young

 will be dead within six months. How you gonna make that happen?

 You're in here at least two years. True, but you see, Paul
