 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: Carlos revealed his deepest desire. It's about

 children. I want them so bad. Tom forced the issue. - You

 sleeping with my wife? - Of course not. Rick came clean. I

 have feelings for you. I know you feel something. You can't work

 here anymore. And Susan's tortured love life... I was on my way

 to propose to you. - ... was finally... - What would you

 have said? ... on the mend. [Mary Alice] Exactly one year had

 passed since the night Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer were supposed to

 become engaged. So when Mike took Susan to her favorite restaurant, she

 just knew he was going to pop the question. What are you

 gonna have? And when he did... The chicken. ... she'd be ready

 with her answer. But as the evening wore on, the moment Susan

 had been waiting for... ... failed to materialize. And though many opportunities

 presented themselves... ... the question was never asked. Until the thought began

 to dawn on Susan, that perhaps... ... it never would. You're pretty

 quiet over there. Was dinner OK? If by \"OK\" you mean uneventful,

 then yes. - Something on your mind? - Mike, what day is

 today? - Wednesday. - Yes. It's also the anniversary of the day

 we were supposed to get engaged. A year ago tonight, you were

 on your way to ask me to marry you when you got

 hit by that stupid car. That was a year ago? Time really

 flies. - Is that all you have to say? - [laughs] Why

 are you getting mad? I thought you were gonna propose tonight! Why

 would I want to commemorate the anniversary of the night that some

 maniac put me in a coma? Because this date has special meaning

 for us. I sat in front of that trailer for six hours

 thinking you hated me, and a proposal would've brought the entire thing

 full circle. It'd have turned a bad memory into a beautiful one.

 You really thought this through, didn't you? Yes, I did. Because I

 am a thoughtful person. And whenever we do get married, that is

 something you are gonna have to work on. I'll do my best.

 By the way... does that seem familiar? Oh, my God. I can't

 believe that you did this. Well, I wanted to... How'd you put

 it? ...turn a bad memory into a beautiful one. Now go sit

 in front of that trailer. I promise I'll show up this time.

 [giggles] [chuckles] [Mary Alice] Yes, Susan knew Mike was about to pop

 the question, the one she thought he'd never ask. Oh, Mike... And

 thanks to Susan... Will you marry me? ... he never did. Luckily,

 it wasn't the question she needed to hear... I kind of had

 a speech prepared, but sure, what the heck? ... it was the

 answer. From the moment we wake up in the morning... What time

 is it? ... till our head hits the pillow at night... Did

 you lock the front door? Our lives are filled with questions. Did

 you remember to buy more shaving cream? Simple ones that are easy

 to answer. Can I still pull this look off? Yeah? But some

 questions are so dangerous, the truth is not an option. - Are

 you mad at Daddy? - No. Why would you think that? -

 Because you're not talking to him. - When two people have known

 each other as long as Mommy and Daddy have, they don't have

 to always talk. A sign of a good relationship is being comfortable

 in silence. True. Although, Mommy ignoring me last night at work wasn't

 what I'd call comfortable. Well, Daddy probably didn't notice that I was

 unloading 20-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them. Mommy

 didn't have time to sit around and chew the fat. Well, you

 haven't wanted to chew the fat for five days now. Come on.

 Something's obviously bugging you. I'm trying to have breakfast with my family

 - and you're picking a fight. - I want to talk! There's

 nothing to talk about. Leave me alone. - Fine. - Good. Sorry

 I asked. Hey, Fran?ois, it's Susan Mayer. Call me as soon as

 you get this. I told you my wedding was off, but it's

 back on, and I wanna see if you're still available to do

 the flowers. Bye. Oh, just so you know, Ian's not the groom

 anymore. Long story. Call me. There, I think I've left messages for

 everyone. Are you sure it's OK for us to have the same

 wedding I was planning with Ian? Be honest. Well, I stole his

 bride, I guess I can poach his florist. Gosh, I just keep

 thinking there's someone I've forgotten to tell. Caterer, band, florist... - Um,

 guests? - Oh, my God! - I had Julie call and cancel

 everyone. - Just call them back. You can't invite people to a

 wedding on the phone! You have to send a proper invitation. Want

 people to think I'm a flake? Hi, Curt, it's Susan Meyer. You

 did my wedding invitations? I'm gonna need another batch. Exactly the same,

 only change the name \"Ian Hainsworth\" to \"Mike Delfino.\" Long story. Call

 me. [exhales] What's with the frown? You trying to get wrinkles before

 the wedding? No, I can't find a good flower girl. Lynette's hinting

 to use Penny, but I saw her in that pre-school sing-along and

 sorry, but we're talking zero charisma. - I had a thought about

 the flower girl. - You did? My cleaning lady has a daughter.

 Where's that picture? Look familiar? Oh, my God, she looks just like

 me when I was that age. That's what I thought. This way,

 the wedding procession starts with you as this beautiful girl, ends with

 you as the stunning bride you've become. I love that you're so

 into this wedding. Most men would be like, \"Yeah. Tell me where

 the church is.\" But you're as obsessed as me. Like a hot

 groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one. Well, can

 you blame me for wanting to make everything as perfect as you?

 - Feel better? - Yeah. There must've been a bad scallop in

 that paella last night. You'd think that half-bottle of tequila you drank

 would've disinfected it. Oh, sorry to interrupt. I'm just, uh, moving some

 stuff over to Susan's house. - You two shacking up now? -

 Actually, we're getting married. - You're kidding! Congratulations! - Thanks. You don't

 waste any time. Wasted a year. Don't want to wake up one

 more day without her lying next to me. Oh, God. Here comes

 what's left of breakfast. And, uh, you two better be careful. All

 this wedding fever going around, you might catch it. [laughs] Yeah, right.

 What? I'm sorry, I didn't realize the concept of our being married

 - was such a thigh-slapper. - Come on, Edie. It's too soon

 for us to be talking marriage. We only started dating. Well, I

 know, but we could live together. We're either at my house or

 your house every night anyway. Yeah, true, but... Well, why not? We're

 not kids anymore, Carlos. And I really care about you. Don't you

 care about me? Of course I do. But... I just took over

 Mike's lease yesterday. Oh, please. Old lady Sims can find another tenant.

 Edie, I already signed the papers. I have a responsibility. That rent

 helps pay for her nursing home. You understand, right? [overlapping chatter] Mrs.

 Sims? Edie? Edie Britt? - Hi! Are you up for a visit?

 - Well, of course! What a nice surprise. I haven't seen you

 for years. Oh, I know. And I feel awful about that. I

 have always liked you so much. You know, Wisteria Lane hasn't been

 the same since you left. Well, with my arthritis, I just couldn't

 live alone anymore. But what I get from renting more than pays

 for this place. Oh, well, that's good. Although, with Mike Delfino getting

 married, - your house is gonna be empty now. - Actually, no.

 A friend of Mike's just signed a lease. A very nice man.

 What was his name? Carlos Solis. - Oh, dear. - What? What

 did Mike tell you about Carlos? Oh, just that he's a nice,

 responsible man. Oh, well, he is when he's sober. He has a

 drinking problem? Well, actually, what I heard is... What am I doing?

 I shouldn't be indulging in idle gossip. - Edie, please! - Smack.

 He does smack. What? Good heavens. Well, he seemed such a nice

 man when I met him. And he's got a good job. I

 know. What is that term? \"Functional junkie.\" This is very upsetting. Maybe

 I should re-think this. No! I should learn to shut my big

 mouth. Here I am blathering on about drugs and prostitutes... Prostitutes? You

 never said anything about prostitutes. And I'm not going to. Frankly, I

 don't want to be on his bad side. Edie, I can't have

 someone like that in my house. - I have to tear up

 this lease. - Oh, no, I can't let you do that. Not

 with your arthritis. Here, you let me. - Gabby! - Oh, Susan!

 Julie told me about Ian. I am so sorry. You must be

 devastated. Hey, Gabby. I see you've picked up the pieces. We got

 engaged last night. We're getting married! Oh, my God! Congratulations! Forget what

 Julie told you about the wedding being off. - It's back on!

 - Really? Same day? I promised people a wedding, they're getting one.

 I'm sorry, I can't make it. I have plans that day. -

 You can change your plans. - No, I really can't. What could

 be more important to you than my wedding? Uh, my wedding? What?

 Oh, I see you got the invitation. You're getting married on my

 wedding day? You cancelled. Victor was in a rush. Didn't think it

 looked good for the mayor to be shacking up. Every date we

 tried, someone had a conflict. Then your date opened up and we

 knew all my friends were available, and well, you know, you too.

 It's really no problem. We'll find another date. Did you think I'd

 want to spend what would've been my wedding day watching someone else

 get married? I am so throwing that bouquet to you. - OK,

 if you think for one second... - It's fine, really. Come on,

 Susan, we've got some calls to make. Oh, right. I have to

 cancel my wedding. Again! - Susan, hi. - Is this a bad

 time? I'm in the middle of something. OK. I wanted to say

 that I'm sorry for getting so snippy yesterday. When I cancelled my

 wedding, you had every right to... - Susan? Susan? Is that my

 Susan? - Fran?ois... I am so sorry that I could not do

 your wedding flowers. But the moment you canceled, your friend here she...

 How you say? \"Scoop me up.\" - You stole my florist? -

 Only because I admire your taste. It's not theft, it's an homage.

 I have left the bouquet and the centerpiece on the table. If

 there are any changes, you let me know. Au revoir. Well, I

 gotta go. I wanna see those flowers! Oh, my God! That's my

 centerpiece! Now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips? In this

 town, in wedding season, I do! Might as well have used my

 caterer and swing band! - Yeah, listen, about that... - Oh, my

 God! - Did you steal my whole wedding? - It was short

 notice, OK? These people are booked months in advance. The only people

 available were the ones you bailed on. Gabby, I spent months planning

 that wedding! [exhales] I see what you're getting at, and you know

 what, you are right. You have been my de facto wedding planner

 and you deserve to get paid. All right. What's the going rate?

 Seven thousand? Eight? - Gabby... - All right, ten. Not going to

 haggle. I don't want to be paid. I want my wedding back.

 Well, you can't have it. If you ask me, I am doing

 you a really big favor. Excuse me? You were rushing into this

 marriage thing too fast. Why don't you give it time and see

 if you and Mike work as a couple? I'm rushing? You met

 Victor three months ago. - I've known Mike three years. - Yeah,

 on and off... Mostly off! What if you tie the knot in

 a month and realize that you miss Ian and Mike misses the

 coma? [gasps] I cannot believe that you just said that. OK. You

 know what? I came over here to give you my response card,

 but here, this is my response! You don't mean that. That's just

 a big dramatic gesture. Oh, no, no, this is a big dramatic

 gesture! - My flowers! - No, they're my flowers! Enjoy your stolen

 wedding. - [scoffs] - [door slams shut] You can't do this! I

 just signed a lease! Sorry. The law says my mom has 72

 hours to change her mind. She's exercising that option. [car door opens,

 closes] - Hey, what's going on? - I've been evicted. - What?

 - Yeah. That was Mrs. Sims' kid. She's giving me 24 hours

 to move out of her house. - That is so weird. -

 It gets weirder. He told me Mrs. Sims is praying for my

 spiritual recovery. Well, when old folks see the end coming, they get

 all religious. [sighs] I guess. So mind if I crash with you

 until I can find a new place? Of course not. Thanks. I'll

 bring my stuff over in the morning. Why wait? I've got boxes

 in the garage. I'll help you start packing now. Edie, did you

 have something to do with this? What? You have to admit, it

 is kind of a coincidence. You ask me to move in, I

 say no, I get evicted... How dare you! I offer to put

 a roof over your head, and you repay me with suspicions and

 insults? I don't even know that I want you in my house!

 - Fine. I'll get a motel. - Whoa, hold on! Let's not

 be hasty! I knew it. You were behind this! OK. If you

 want to fight, fine. But let's talk about the real issue here.

 Why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me? I

 don't want to talk about this. Well, you never do, but you

 owe me an explanation. Why don't you want to move in with

 me? Because I'm not in love with you. Edie, I'm sorry. I

 really like you, I... No, I get it. It's just a little

 upsetting because... [sighs]... I'm late. Edie, you can't be pregnant. You're on

 the pill. I might've forgotten to take it a couple of days.

 I've been nauseous for an entire week. So I went and got

 a pregnancy test. I figure I should find out if I'm carrying

 your love child. Oh, wait, my mistake. Your \"like\" child. - So?

 What does it say? - It's gonna take a couple more minutes.

 I just peed on that. For God's sake, put it on a

 coaster. [groans] This is just dandy. I'm 40, single and knocked up.

 But on the bright side, the dad's not into me. Hmm. If

 you are pregnant, I'm not gonna let you go through this alone.

 [scoffs] So what? You're gonna be my Lamaze partner? No. I'm saying

 I'll step up. I'll be there to help you raise him. You

 serious? Hey, I was there practically every day to help you with

 Travers. What makes you think that I'd do any less if it

 were my child? Well, thanks. That's nice to know. You know... ...your

 spare bedroom would make a great nursery. Yeah, I guess it would.

 It's down the hall from the master. We'd hear him when he

 was crying. We? You'd move in? I told you that I would

 be here for you. We could even decorate his room in, like,

 a whole pirate theme. I always wanted to do that if I

 had a son. You know what would be really cool? Decorate his

 bed like... Like a ship with a sail and a mast... Carlos,

 it's negative. Oh. Well, that's a relief, huh? - Yeah. We really

 dodged a bullet. - [sighs] So... let's celebrate, have a drink. Oh,

 and by the way, you're still welcome to stay, until you find

 a place. That's nice of you. Thanks. I cannot thank you enough

 for doing this. Thanks for taking the time out of your day.

 I'm not sure this is the best approach. I've never done a

 session before where half of the couple didn't know I was a

 marriage counselor. We'll tell her. Eventually. I just don't want to scare

 her off. - Hey, Lynette... - Yeah? Look who walked in off

 the streets! Scott McKinney. Remember? We pledged Alpha Tau together. I told

 you about him. - You won the beer pong championship. - You

 told her about that? Yeah. Then you threw up in the trophy.

 That is far from his only accomplishment. He's got a Ph.D. Oh,

 wow. Well, I'd love to chat, but I have cheese to grate.

 Wait... Honey, no, wait, please... I will do that later. I want

 you guys to know each other. I mean, this guy, this is

 my boy. So Scott got married the same year that we did.

 How's your wife liking Fairview? Well, her whole family's back east, so

 she kind of resisted the move. Really? So that was a source

 of conflict? Yes, well, all couples have their conflicts. - I'm sure

 you've had your share. - Oh, sure, now and then. - Emphasis

 on \"now.\" - Tom... Scott shared with us. We're going through kind

 of a rough patch. I'm sure it's something you'll get through. The

 trick is to keep lines of communication open. Boy, easier said than

 done. So this rough patch, what would you say is the underlying

 issue there? Well, Scott, I'm not sure I would say. Particularly not

 to someone I just met. Well, he's just trying to help. If

 you ask me, I'd say it started when our manager Rick quit.

 OK, and how did that make you feel, Lynette? I am not

 answering that! This is not a therapy session! But if it were,

 what would you say? - Oh, dear God, you didn't. - What...

 Didn't what? OK, OK. Give it up, Tom. Yes, yes, Lynette, I

 am a couples counselor. Really? And what do you call this, \"ambush

 therapy\"? It was my idea. I'm just trying to get you to

 talk about what is going on. And don't tell me that nothing's

 going on! Good, good. All our cards are on the table. Cram

 it! OK, yeah, Tom, I've been unhappy lately. I am working through

 some issues. That is something I need to do on my own.

 Talking about it doesn't help. Not to you, and certainly not to

 Dr. Beer Pong! Well, I'm billing you for a whole hour, so

 is there anything else on your mind? I'm sorry, but this time

 Gabby has crossed a line, and I will not sit through her

 wedding. Julie thinks I'm overreacting. You don't think I'm overreacting, do you?

 - Yeah, a little. - Absolutely not. What? She asked. Look, even

 if Gabby's in the wrong here... And she is. Hugely, hideously wrong.

 Do you really want to boycott her wedding? She said that I

 would make Mike wish he was back in a coma! I think

 her point, and again, I wish she'd expressed herself more tactfully, was

 that marriage is unpredictable. We can't know what it'll be until we're

 in it. Don't defend that self-centered brat. She steals Susan's wedding and

 then expects to stay friends. She divorces Carlos and doesn't want anyone

 else to date him. I've never known anyone as dishonest and manipulative.

 Speaking of Carlos, I hear he got evicted. Yeah, that was a

 real shocker. Anyway, you stick to your guns and don't you dare

 go to that wedding. It could ruin your friendship. Are you willing

 to take that chance? - [sighs] No, I guess not. - Wuss.

 Well, at least get her a thoughtless, crappy gift. - Like a

 blender. - I got you a blender for Christmas. And I use

 it every day. Gotta go. [gasps] Honey, I am so sorry! I

 hope you don't hate me! I don't! I was just on my

 way to apologize to you. - I changed all my flowers. -

 You don't have to. The hell I don't. Those peach tulips belong

 to you. And so do these. Thank you. I was just bringing

 you this. Well, we got chocolate and wine... - Your place or

 mine? - Well... I am so glad we're doing this. I hate

 it when we fight. Me too. And I'm so sorry about that

 comment I made about Mike. It was way out of line. You

 guys are gonna be insanely happy. I think so too. But, you

 know, then I remember, that's what I thought about me and Karl.

 Please. Mike is not Karl. Well, you know, when I married him,

 Karl wasn't Karl. And I think that's why I got so mad

 at you. Because 99 percent of me is sure that we're gonna

 be totally happy, but then what you said, it just stirred up

 that pesky one percent. Honey, please. If anyone should be nervous it's

 me. I met Victor three months ago. I mean, I'm crazy about

 him. It's just the thought of saying those vows again, it's scary.

 Lynette is right. You know, marriage is like... It's like these bonbons.

 You never know what you're getting until you're in the middle of

 it. It's one of those hard, jelly ones. - Do you think

 that's an omen? - Honey, you're gonna be OK. All right? We're

 gonna help each other through this. Right. Yeah. Getting married is scary,

 but at least we'll be doing it together. Oh, my God! We

 should totally do that. - What? - Get married! Together! You and

 me? Well, I... I'm beyond flattered, I find you to be an

 incredibly attractive woman. I just... Oh, no, stupid! I mean a double

 wedding! Oh. Oh! Oh, I would love that! I know! Then you

 wouldn't be mad, and I wouldn't feel guilty! - We could be

 brides together! - Together! Yes! Let's celebrate! More chocolate! So you know,

 if I was a lesbian, I'd totally do you. That's good to

 know. [Mary Alice] It's a fact of life that brides to be,

 who agree to double weddings late at night, often feel differently, come

 the dawn. This change of heart was certainly true in the case

 of Susan Mayer. And even more so... ... for Gabrielle Solis. -

 Morning. - Hi, honey. I hope I didn't wake you last night.

 I was at Susan's till midnight. - Is something wrong? - No.

 Not exactly. Just a small change of plans about the wedding. What

 kind of change? See, Susan was really upset... I mean, I've never

 seen Gabby so torn up with guilt... Practically in tears over this

 whole wedding date thing... And she kept saying, \"Please, let me make

 it up to you...\" So, after an hour of this, I suddenly

 heard myself say... \"Hey, how about a double wedding?\" Wanted to bite

 my tongue the minute it came out. She's so excited, so needy...

 Jumping up and down and hugging me... - I mean, what could

 I say? - So we're kind of stuck. So, what do you

 think? I think anything that makes you happy is fine by me.

 - Will this make you happy? - No! I'm screwed! I cannot

 get out of this without hurting her feelings. Maybe this will help.

 I forbid it. - You do? - Sure. Tell her that your

 groom's an old-fashioned guy and he doesn't want to see anybody on

 that altar but his bride. If she gets mad, have her take

 it up with me. So this is what marriage is about, having

 someone to hide behind. - So, what do you think? - You're

 gonna have to undo this. How? I know I shouldn't have offered,

 but I did. - I can't take it back. - You're gonna

 have to. You have any idea what this day means to me?

 I do. And I know you've worked really hard to make our

 wedding perfect. Exactly. I want to share it with your friend and

 her ex-convict fianc?? - That's your problem? - I'm the mayor of

 this town. How's it gonna look? There'll be press there. - Press?

 At our wedding? - Well, we're public figures. So all of this

 planning, and attention to detail, - that's all been about your image?

 - Of course not! This is gonna be the proudest day of

 my life. I'm not sharing the spotlight with anyone. How about the

 bride? Oh, please, every eye in that place is gonna be on

 you. Every woman will wish they were you, every guy'll wish they

 had you. It's gonna be great. Tell your friends you're sorry. Tell

 them I'll even pay for their wedding. But they're not sharing mine.

 [sighs] Here's a one-bedroom at The Oaks with a view of the

 golf course. That's gonna go fast. I'm gonna call on this first

 thing in the morning. Or, I know this is the last thing

 you'd expect to hear from me, but what if you stayed here

 with me and we tried to have a baby? Are you serious?

 I saw the look on your face when that test came back

 negative. Admit it, you were disappointed. - Yeah, maybe a little. -

 Well, so was I. - You were? - Yeah, I was. You

 know, having Travers here made me realize that I like being a

 mom. And you were so great with him. Well, think... We could

 have that all the time. Edie, nobody wants a kid more than

 me. It's just... Yeah, yeah, we're not head over heels in love.

 We like each other, right? That's more than a lot of parents

 have going for them. - It's just a very big step. -

 Carlos, look around. Everyone's taking big steps. Gabby and Victor, Susan and

 Mike. This could be our step. We both need to love someone.

 No one said it had to be each other. Just think about

 it. Let's do it. - You really want to? - Yeah. I'm

 tired of waiting for my life to start. Oh, Carlos. Imagine, with

 your genes and mine, that child is gonna be a knockout. [giggles]

 I'm gonna brush my teeth, I'm gonna flush those birth control pills

 and we're gonna get crackin'! - Hey. - Hey. - How're you

 doing? - Good. Listen, we need to talk. I spoke to Mike

 and he's just not really into the whole double wedding thing. Mike

 said no? Yeah, he sort of wants the day just to be

 about us. So we're gonna wait until the fall. I am so

 sorry. No, no, it's OK. Victor was kind of on the fence

 about it too. Oh, good! I mean, not that they said no,

 I really wanted to do it. Me too. I think it would

 have been so much fun. - Yeah. - Well, I gotta go.

 - I gotta meet Fran?ois. - See ya. Oh, by the way...

 That one-percent sliver of a doubt thing I told you about? Totally

 gone. Any question I had about Mike's been answered. That must feel

 really great. Yeah. - I feel really good about this. - I

 do too. Our friends are probably gonna make fun of us. Yeah,

 I'm sure. But who cares. It's gonna be great. I'm so happy

 we're gonna be living together. We're going to have so much fun.

 I'll be right out. OK... let's make a baby. - I talked

 to my back doctor today. - What did he have to say?

 He said, assuming I exercise reasonable caution, I can have sex again.

 And what would that have to do with me? Well, you don't

 seem to want to talk to me these days, so I figured

 it's the one thing that we can do together without speaking. Remember

 when I was giving birth to the twins and screaming in agony

 because Porter was dragging my uterus out with him? Well, I was

 more in the mood for sex then than I am now. -

 Lynette... - Hmm? I'm your husband, I have to find a way

 to connect to you somehow. So we can have sex or we

 can talk. Your call. - Fine. Let's have sex. - What? Yeah,

 let's get this off. You'd rather have sex with me than talk

 to me? - Yep. - Hey... Ow! That hurts! I said I'd

 have sex, I didn't say I'd make love. You want to play

 rough? Because I can play rough! Cut it out! Sorry, I'll try

 to be gentler as I move down south. OK... OK. OK, fine.

 You are mad at me! But name one thing that I have

 done to deserve it! You had lunch with Rick. You're damn right

 I did! I saw the security tape. What was I supposed to

 do? Pretend that nothing was going on? Nothing was! He never touched

 me! And I wasn't gonna sit around and wait until it did.

 - I am glad that I made him quit. - You didn't

 make him quit. I fired him! - You what? - Idiot told

 me he had feelings for me, which he never'd have done if

 you hadn't pushed! And now he's gone. It's all your fault! -

 Ow! My back! - [grunts] - [glass shatters] - [groans] Lynette? Honey?

 [woman over intercom, indistinct] It'll just be a few more minutes, Mrs.

 Scavo. - The doctor's looking at your CAT scan. - Thank you.

 This whole thing is ridiculous. I bumped my head. Lynette, you were

 dizzy and throwing up. - Can't be too careful. - Well, I

 feel just fine now. When Rick said he had feelings for you...

 ...what did you say? I said that it was totally inappropriate, and

 then I fired him. - Do you have feelings for him, Lynette?

 - Hmm? Do you have feelings for Rick? I would never cheat

 on you. You know that. That's not what I asked. Did you

 fall for him? Oh, God. Nothing happened. He's gone. It's over. Don't

 tell me it's over. We've been fighting all week. You miss him,

 don't you? - Don't do this. - Damn. Not now. I can't.

 - Mrs. Scavo? - That's me. I'll be back. Actually, I'd rather

 have you both come in for this. - Is it a concussion?

 - No, it's just a bruise. Oh, good. But I noticed something

 in your CAT scan that concerns me. Oh. You have a few

 swollen lymph nodes in your neck. - I want to send you

 in for a biopsy. - A biopsy? Why? Have you noticed any

 change in your appetite lately? Any fatigue, fevers? Stop, just stop. What

 is it you think I have? I don't want you to panic.

 This can be any number of things. Is one of them cancer?

 It could be lymphoma. We're hoping the biopsy will rule that out.

 If you look at the CAT scan... ...you can see this white
