 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... Paul was shocked to find Felicia was back on

 the lane. Well, hello, Paul. Tom's new job came with perks. You

 know what you can do on a private jet? Anything. A relationship

 was forced to end. We are no longer friends. Not you and

 me, and not you and Gabby. You can't speak for me. I

 just did! And Susan got her transplant, thanks to Paul. I'm sure

 as soon as I sign the papers they'll be contacting you. After

 Susan Delfino's kidney transplant, her doctor ordered her to abstain from sex

 for six weeks. But what the doctor couldn't prevent Susan from doing

 was dreaming about it. These dreams were filled with torrid caresses, with

 passionate kisses, and with soft cries of ecstasy. The only thing missing

 from these dreams was her husband. Are you okay? Uh... Yeah. I

 just had a dream. Yeah, I know. You know? What do you

 know? Was I saying something? Was I talking? More like moaning. Oh,

 moaning? Oh, God! Yeah, you mentioned him, too. Don't be embarrassed. So

 you had a sex dream. It's not surprising, given how long we've

 had to lay off. Tell me. What were we doing? Ah... We...

 Hey. Maybe we can recreate it when we end our drought in

 two days, 17 hours and 35 minutes. Well, uh, needless to say,

 it was some pretty kinky stuff. Like, do we do that thing,

 that thing we talked about? Mike, it was my dream, not yours.

 Oh, God. I'm desperate. Can you give me some details? Uh... Or

 I could show you in two days, 17 hours and 34 minutes.

 That'll work. I can't wait. We'll send MJ to Mrs. McCluskey's and

 have the whole night together. Yes, Susan was having dreams about sex.

 Just the two of us. Uh-huh. Just me and you. And they

 were becoming a nightmare. The residents of Wisteria Lane are nothing if

 not loyal. They love their country. They root for the home team.

 They support their favorite brand. But the fiercest loyalty on Wisteria Lane

 is the one between friends. All right, I gotta run. I'm meeting

 the girls for coffee. Stop. Which girls? Will Bree be there? She

 better be. She's buying. Then you're not going. Wait, you were serious

 about us never speaking to Bree again? That woman sat at our

 table, spent the holidays with us, all the while knowing her son

 ran over my mother. Yeah, I'm serious. Fine. Then you stop talking

 to her. But you're not gonna control me. 'Cause I have the

 secret weapon. You'll withhold sex? Please. You always fold before I do.

 That's not true. The last time you tried, you got so turned

 on telling me what you weren't gonna do to me, you wound

 up doing it to me right then. Damn it. Well, you're still

 not gonna stop me from seeing Bree. Yes, I am. Our relationship

 with that woman is over, and I forbid you to see her

 again. He forbid me. Who is he to forbid me? I mean,

 what is this, nineteen... Whenever it was that husbands got to forbid

 their wives? Gabby, he has every reason to be upset. I hate

 to say this, but I think we should keep our distance for

 a while. What? I'm not giving in to this. I've already caused

 Carlos so much pain. I think it's the only thing we can

 do. So, what are you saying? No more poker, no more lunches,

 no more shopping? I'll miss it as much as you do. Oh,

 really? Doesn't sound like it. I think this is easy for you.

 Easy? I wanna come over there right now so you can drag

 me to the mall kicking and screaming, but we can't. I have

 to go. I have scones in the oven. I love your scones.

 Stop. Goodbye, Gabby. You're not hanging up. But I have to. Hey,

 Lynette, you're not gonna believe this! Shh! I had to walk Paige

 around the block eight times to get her down. Nothing is so

 important that you need to raise your voice. Not even this? The

 Weisman Leadership Conference? Seriously? You're invited? And so are you. Oh, my

 God! Warren Buffett goes to this conference, and Bill Gates, and Oprah!

 It's one of her Favorite Things. Look at this. All the great

 speakers! Plus they've got the spa, and... And no kids, right? No

 kids? No kids. Yes! Yes! You take her. I gotta figure out

 what to wear. Hey, you two! Thanks for watching him. Hey. Can

 you watch him again on Wednesday? Mike and I are... Yeah, I

 know. Your big night, huh? Mike told you? Didn't have to. I

 caught him staring at my cleavage. So, post-transplant sex, huh? If it's

 as good as my post-cancer sex, you're in for a treat. Fingers

 crossed. Hey, have you looked at your old house lately? It's kind

 of a wreck. It does look a little neglected. You should go

 over and talk to Paul. I'll watch MJ. Oh. I can't do

 that. I mean, he might be in the middle of something. Or

 he might be hanging from the shower head. Do me a favor

 and check, 'cause if he is dead in there, I live downwind.

 Susan? Paul. Paul! Uh, hi, there. I was just in the neighborhood,

 and it looked like things were piling up, and... Would you mind

 closing that robe, please? Oh, sorry. And sorry about the mess. I

 haven't been getting out of the house much. You look thin. Are

 you eating? Yes. I'm fine. I'm a little behind on my chores.

 So, if there's nothing else... Paul, are you sure you're okay? Yes,

 Susan. Fit as a fiddle. Goodbye. I've already spotted two ex-senators and

 three covers of Forbes. Everybody here is definitely A-list. Oh! Bob! Lee!

 Hey, hey, you fancy hot shots! Hi! -Hiya. -Hi. I'm glad you've

 done this conference before, 'cause I'm definitely gonna need somebody to show

 me the ropes. Nothing to it. Just don't talk politics. And don't

 push Warren Buffett in the pool. I didn't push him. He got

 between me and the margarita bar. Oh, let me introduce you to

 Barry Weisman. Prepare to endure the single most bone-crushing handshake of your

 life. Bye. Come on. With this line it's gonna be hard to

 get drunk. Lesson one, the power of the words, \"The President's Council

 of Economic Advisors want their martinis now.\" I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's

 a little trick I learned when I was too cheap to buy

 my own newspaper. How fantastic is it that Chris Cavanaugh is speaking?

 I thought Flashpoint was the best business book of the year. I

 agree. I've heard him speak before. He's even better in person. We're

 in for a treat tomorrow. -Meg Butler. President of AMTech. -Oh! Um...

 Lynette Scavo. My husband is the CFO of Morris Technologies. Oh! You're

 a Plus One. What's that mean? Unfortunately, it means you won't be

 seeing Chris Cavanaugh. The seminars are only for participants. What am I

 gonna be doing? I will tell you what, Japanese flower arranging. Did

 I weep at the simple beauty of my design last year? Yes,

 yes, I did. I don't wanna arrange flowers. Why are they dividing

 us up like this? Maybe it's because some of us spent our

 lives working our way up the corporate ladder, and others just married

 someone who did. Excuse me. Oh, no, no, no. No, no. Wow.

 That is ridiculous. I really wanna see those seminars. Hey, don't worry.

 You are going to love what they have planned for us. Attention!

 If I could have all of my Plus Ones find a buddy,

 we're going to get to know each other with a scavenger hunt!

 Come on! Bree. Gabby. What are you doing here? I just came

 by to talk to Lynette. She's out of town. She asked me

 to water the plants and collect the mail. Oh! You look good.

 You, too. New coat? You noticed. I should go. Can't you just

 stay and talk? Maybe have a cup of coffee? Gabby, we shouldn't.

 It's just coffee, Bree. But your husband... He'd never look for us

 here. Come on, it's been really hard for me not seeing you.

 It's been hard for me, too. Especially with Lynette out of town.

 I mean, there's Susan, of course, but lately, whatever topic you bring

 up, she manages to steer it right back to kidneys! Tell me

 about it. Well, I guess I could put on a pot. I

 like mine with cream. I know how you like it. Hello, Karen.

 Felicia! Hi. When did they let you out? About a week ago.

 I just stopped by because I wanted you to have this. It

 belonged to my sister, and she was always so fond of you.

 That's sweet. It's my small way of saying thanks for keeping my

 secret all those years. Yeah, not much of a secret anymore. Don't

 I know it. But I've kept your secret. I never told a

 soul about your role that night, and I never will. Uh... It's

 not really a good time to talk about that. I understand. But

 I hope you'll stop by my place sometime. We have so much

 catching up to do. Sure. I'll do that. Where are you staying?

 Haven't you heard? I'm moving in next door. We're going to be

 neighbors. Who was that? Just an old friend. Old friend? You look

 like you've seen a ghost. Make me a drink, will you, sweetie?

 Toby! Here, kitty, kitty! Toby, where are you? Here, kitty, kitty. Toby.

 Felicia, help me out. Ida Greenberg's lost her stupid cat again. What

 happened to you? Is that blood? You never saw me. I have

 to go. Your hand! Let me call you an ambulance. You loved

 my sister, right? Martha? Yeah. And you know Paul Young murdered her.

 There's no doubt in my mind. Oh, my God. Did you kill

 Paul? No! He killed me. What? They'll find my blood in his

 house and my fingers in the car, and he'll spend the rest

 of his life in prison, if you say you never saw me.

 Don't ask me to do this. Please, Karen! Paul got away with

 Martha's murder, but he won't get away with mine. Toby. Here, kitty,

 kitty. Ikebana is all about bringing together nature and humanity. The three

 main branches, or shushi, represent chi, earth, ten, heaven, and jin, man.

 Interesting. Nothing to represent \"woman.\" How about this insignificant clump of moss?

 We could stuff it down at the bottom, where it will only

 speak when spoken to. Does my chi look a little droopy? Did

 you hear me? Yes. Yes, Lynette, I heard you. I heard you

 during yoga, during the fashion show, all through salsa dancing. \"Life is

 unfair.\" Ol?! Well, I'm sorry, but I came here to learn new

 things and meet interesting people, not to pretend that putting sticks in

 a vase is art. Are we still having a problem? Yes, we

 still are. Doesn't it piss you all off that we are stuck

 in our gilded cage, forbidden to go to interesting seminars just because

 we're Plus Ones? No! This is fun! I really feel like I'm

 in Japan. This is the United States of America in the 21st

 century, not some oppressive patriarchal regime. It may be small and red,

 but this lanyard is no better than a burqa! Oh, dear. We

 need to storm the gates and demand to be let inside! If

 you're not gonna use the rest of your flowers, can... Come on!

 Rise up! If we do it together, we will not be denied!

 4:00, people! I think you've all earned a cocktail. No. No! No.

 Do not drink those! Those are the cocktails of oppression, made from

 equal parts tyranny, and blind obedience, and... Oh, screw it. Mmm! This

 is the best pineapple upside-down cake you have ever made. You know

 why? It has an ingredient my cakes have never had before. Danger.

 I know! Sneaking around makes everything taste better. When I was with

 John Rowland, every sense was heightened. It was like this... Skip it.

 You wouldn't understand. Oh, really? Wouldn't I? What? You? No way. Just

 because I don't trumpet my indiscretions like you do, doesn't mean I

 haven't had a little walk on the wild side. You cheated on

 Rex? Of course not! What do you take me for? I cheated

 on Orson. With who? Karl Mayer. Oh, my God! He was a

 slimeball, but he was hot. We'd meet at this cheap hotel, and

 as guilty as it made me, I still felt this tingle, this

 frisson I'd never felt before. And now this week with you, it's

 back. Hmm! I just wish Lynette didn't have to come home tomorrow.

 Actually, that motel story gives me an idea. Gabby, I'm flattered, but

 I really don't think we should... Not that. There's a great new

 spa that just opened on Foster Lake. We should go next weekend.

 Do we dare? I think we both know the answer to that.

 I went by our house today. It's looking a little run-down. Yeah?

 You want me to talk to Paul? He's supposed to be keeping

 the place up. Actually, I already did. He seems kind of run-down,

 too. What are you doing, talking to Paul? I was picking up

 MJ. And he came out of the house and... I'm kind of

 worried about him. Why? Who cares? Mike, he gave me a kidney.

 No, Beth gave you a kidney. Paul did everything he could to

 block it. Yeah, but we talked. And after, he seemed so sad.

 I don't give a damn. I know you feel bad for the

 guy, but I don't trust him. Please, just do me a favor

 and stay away from him. Okay. Now, can we talk about something

 a little more fun? Like our plan for sex night? Okay, hold

 that thought. I'm gonna take a shower. May I come in? Please.

 Lynette, what are you doing here? I thought you had a spa

 thing. Oh, please. I can get a face full of steam standing

 over a pot of spaghetti any night of the week. I wanna

 see Chris Cavanaugh. I know. And I asked, and they said no.

 The keynote speech isn't for spouses. They said they've got other activities

 planned for you. Activities that they planned for me? Tom, I'm not

 a child. I'm a grownup. I'll decide what I want to do.

 Come on, don't you know how much I wanna see this guy?

 Can't you pull some strings? I don't have any strings. When I've

 been five or six times, then maybe I can ask for a

 favor. But not now! There you are! Someone's been naughty. Let's go,

 Mrs. Scavo. I think it's somebody's spa time. This is why you

 keep us drunk, huh? So we don't fight back? This hits the

 spot. I remembered you like your coffee same way you like your

 men, strong and Irish. So, how did you get out of jail

 so soon? Was it good behavior, or bad behavior with the warden?

 Oh, Karen. How I've missed your frank and salty questions. Actually, it

 was, what they call humanitarian release. You see, my only daughter passed

 away just recently. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had a daughter.

 Such a sweet girl. So young. She was barely 30 when she

 died. I wish I could have met her. Actually, I'm pretty sure

 you did. Her name was Beth. Beth Young. Can I freshen that?

 So, we'll cut you back to 10 every other day on the

 Prednisone and take it from there. Any questions? I do have one.

 Shoot. Is it common for patients to have sex dreams about the

 husbands of their dead donors? I have to admit, I did not

 see that coming. Understand, awake, I have no conscious desire for this

 man. But in my dreams... Susan, I'm not a psychologist. But you

 went to med school. You must have learned something about dreams. A

 course, a book? Okay. What did you talk about before you went

 to sleep? -I was talking about him. -Oh. I mean, he's not

 doing very well, and I got in an argument with my husband

 about whether I should help him. Well, maybe the dream is telling

 you to follow that impulse. The man's wife died. You're alive because

 of it. It's natural to be concerned about him and wanna make

 sure he's okay. Mike really doesn't want me to talk to him.

 It's your call, but my guess is your dreams won't stop until

 you do. When Paul went to jail, his one goal was to

 make me pay for putting him there. So he wrote to Beth,

 begging her to come see him. He said he was innocent, that

 he was a good man. Paul is very charming when he wants

 to be, and Beth, she fell in love with him. Just like

 he knew she would. Didn't you try to warn her? Of course.

 She just said I didn't know him like she did. When he

 was released, when he had defiled her, the real Paul came out.

 He said he'd never loved her, that she was stupid and that

 she didn't deserve to live. So she killed herself. Just like he

 knew she would. Bastard. I hope you'll keep this story between us,

 at least for now. Beth would hate for all her friends to

 know what a fool she was. Okay. But the one thing I

 don't get is, why do you wanna live on the same street

 as that monster? So I can watch him! It's too late for

 Beth and my sister, but I won't let him destroy another woman

 the way he destroyed them. Well, you're not watching him alone because

 I'll keep my eye on that SOB too. Now, if you need

 anything, anything at all, you give me a call. Oh, Karen. I'm

 so lucky to have a friend like you. It's wonderful what a

 four-handed massage can do. One more hand, and it would've been perfect.

 But this ain't that kind of spa. Yeah. No. No. Tell him

 he has a choice. He can sign those papers before I shove

 them down his throat, or after they come out the other end.

 I guess someone didn't see the \"No Cell Phones\" sign. I guess

 that rule only applies to Plus Ones. I'll talk to you later.

 I wanna grab a soak before the keynote speech. Bye. - Ms.

 Butler? -Huh? Oh, hi. Yes, I'm her. She's me. Meg Butler. Meg.

 We have a seat for you up front. Oh! Uh... Uh... Great.

 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Now, to introduce our keynote speaker, the President

 of AMTech, Ms. Meg Butler. Come on. Come on. Hi. Those of

 you who know Meg know I'm not Meg. Nutmeg. That's funny. Anyway,

 Meg asked me to introduce Chris Cavanaugh because she knows what a

 huge, huge fan I am. Where are you, you big-brained rascal? Oh!

 There he is. Almost as hot as his author photo. Anyway, those

 of you who haven't read Flashpoint, do it immediately. Put it in

 your Kindle, your iPad. I don't know, buy the book. It will

 make you smarter, because what Chris Cavanaugh has to say about human

 nature, about creativity, is absolutely... There she is! That's the bitch who

 stole my lanyard. And my clothes! Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Cavanaugh. Hi.

 I called you a bunch of times. Your phone must be broken.

 It is now. Please respect my privacy. Paul, you have to let

 me talk to you. Why? Because you're a mess, and someone has

 to do something. And, okay, I'm having dreams about us. Dreams? What

 kind of dreams? Regular dreams. Lots of daylight, lots of clothes. Look,

 I'm your landlord, I have a right to come in. But I'd

 like you to invite me in. Getting ready to cook something? I

 see onions, potatoes. This long, green and white thing with scary little

 hairs on the bottom. This is food, right? It's called a leek.

 I was trying to make potato leek soup. I love potato leek

 soup. Of course, that was before I knew what a leek was.

 You want some help? Come on. Soup I can do. Making soup?

 Is that what we were doing in your dream? No, no, we

 weren't. That reminds me, I need to wash my hands. Hey. How

 was the big conference? Okay. You meet any guys for me? I'm

 not picky. You know what they say, \"Ugly plus money equals handsome!\"

 Well, apparently, crazy plus wife equals laughing stock. You two having a

 fight? Yeah, kind of. Well, you won't even know I'm here. Tom,

 why don't we finish this later? I'm sorry, do you not wanna

 be embarrassed in front of your friend? Well, she just embarrassed me

 in front of the whole Fortune 500. I don't know how many

 different ways I can apologize. At some point, you're gonna have to

 let it go. I kind of don't feel like letting it go,

 Lynette. It's not just the fact that you humiliated me. It's that

 after all those years that I supported you, took a back seat

 to your career, you couldn't do the same for me. What happened?

 It was awful! All weekend, I was treated like a Plus One,

 a second-class citizen... A wife! Lynette, in Tom's world, that's what you

 are. You're gonna have to get used to it. What if I

 don't wanna get used to it? Well, take it from someone who

 spent eight years being Mrs. Third Baseman. You can be a wife,

 or you can be a first wife. I'm home. Hi, honey. How

 was your day? I worked straight through lunch and I'm starving. What's

 this? It's a pineapple upside-down cake. Wow. Reminds me of the cake

 your old friend Bree brought to dinner last month. Huh, I don't

 remember that. 'Cause obviously, Bree didn't make this one, since I don't

 see her anymore 'cause I know how you feel about her. So,

 where'd this come from? I made it. Really? The woman who ordered

 in Chinese food for Christmas dinner made a pineapple upside-down cake? Well,

 it's not that hard. It's just some pineapples and upside-down cake. You

 know what? This looks so good, I would love for you to

 make me one just like it. Right now? Yeah. And I'm gonna

 sit here and watch you. Every step of the way. Sure. No

 problem. Uh... First, I'm gonna get some flour 'cause you can't make

 a cake without flour, right? Oh, no! I got it all over

 me. Maybe I should take my top off. In fact, why don't

 you and I go up to the bedroom... Make the cake. Wow,

 you really are hungry. Well, let me freshen up first. He wants

 you to make a pineapple upside-down cake? The woman who ordered in

 Chinese for Christmas? Yes, we've already covered that. Now what am I

 gonna do? If I can't make this, he's gonna know I've been

 seeing you! Just stall him. I'll make one and slip it to

 you. No, he wants to watch me make it. Okay, don't panic.

 We can do this. How? Okay, one pineapple upside-down cake coming right

 up. First, pre-heat your oven to 300. First, I'm gonna pre-heat my

 oven to 300. Then, we're gonna start with the caramel topping. And

 then, we're gonna start with the caramel topping. For which I will

 need sugar. Brown sugar. And butter. How much butter? Who are you

 talking to? Oh... My grandmother. See, this was her recipe, and talking

 to her makes me feel like we're making it together. How much

 butter, Grandma? Quarter cup. Got it. And? It's very good. It is?

 Hot damn. You know, truthfully, I was just kind of winging it.

 And if you don't taste the wine, it's 'cause I drank it.

 When was the last time you and I had a meal together?

 It had to be before Mary Alice died. That was a long

 time ago. Maybe we should start doing that again. Susan, why are

 you doing this? Why do you care? MJ! No running! Leave him

 alone. It's nice to see something moving fast in here. Thanks. And

 just to warn you, we might be a little late picking him

 up. Yeah? Looks like you're going to be a little late getting

 started. I remember a guy that used to live on this street.

 He taught my daughter to swim. He made a killer barbecue tri-tip.

 He had a laugh you could hear three houses away. I liked

 that guy. I'm not that man anymore. I think you can be.

 You know... I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing?

 I asked you not to come here. I know. But Paul is

 suffering. And everyone else has turned their back on him. You know

 why? 'Cause he's a bad guy. Look, you might have fallen for

 his act, but I haven't. And I'm not gonna let you put

 yourself in danger. Get in the car. We're going. I'm not going

 anywhere. Mike, believe it or not, I am not an idiot. I

 don't need to be rescued from whatever trouble it is you think

 I'm getting myself into. You don't know this guy like I do.

 I know the look in somebody's eyes when they're hurting. And I

 am not leaving until I know that Paul is okay. So you're

 going back in there? Yeah. Support me or not, that's what I'm

 doing. Oh! I heard an oven timer go off. Let's take a

 look. No! No, not yet. The secret's all in the cooling. In

 fact, it'll probably cool faster on the windowsill. Hi, we're collecting for

 juvenile... Out of my way! Hot cake! Okay, but while we're waiting,

 there's just one thing I have to say. Hey, this is not

 about a cake. This is about trust. It is a sad day

 when a husband forces a wife to bake for him just to

 prove she's not a liar. Do you have any idea how offensive

 that is? Cake's ready. Ah! There. One perfect pineapple upside-down cake. If

 only trust were so easy to make. You look surprised. I am.

 After the way I talked to you, I was kind of expecting

 the firing squad. I thought about it, but I decided to go

 for the romantic dinner. Figured less cleanup. Honey, I understand how you

 feel about Paul. I know you're just trying to protect me. And

 you're just being you. The woman that makes me pull over to

 the side of the road in a rainstorm to pick up a

 sick raccoon. In my defense, I did think it was a cat.

 The point is, I can't stay mad at you for being the

 kind, compassionate woman you are. Especially since it's been six weeks since

 we've had sex. That, too. You sure you're okay watching the girls

 all weekend? Hey, you can't miss your old modeling friend's funeral. Yeah.

 We were really close. Well, you get to see some old friends,

 maybe even reconnect with a few. Maybe. Look, I know it's been

 hard for you to not see Bree, but it has meant a

 lot to me. Nice coat. Is it new? Yeah, I just bought

 it this week. So then this long red hair must have got

 on it pretty recently. It's not what you think. I took Juanita

 to a kid's birthday party, and I hugged a clown. You hugged

 a clown? His monkey died. He was very emotional. So you're off

 to a funeral, huh? What are you doing? Don't open that. I

 packed it very carefully! I can see that. One, two, three bikinis.

 Is your friend being buried at sea? Stop it. I'm gonna be

 late. Late for what? A weekend getaway with Bree? Damn it, Gabby,

 I forbade you to see her. Well, that was your first mistake.

 What did you expect? I expected you to choose me! You know,

 ever since we moved to this street and you got so tight

 with those women, I always feel like you put them first. You

 know that's not true. Prove it. Choose. Who do you want in

 your life, me or Bree? Don't do this. I am doing it,

 Gabby. Choose. Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane are nothing if not

 loyal. But there are times when that loyalty is put to the

 test. By the desire to help a stricken friend, by the need

 to protect a long-buried secret, by the movement of two lives in

 opposite directions. And sometimes, just as one test of loyalty ends, another

 begins. Gabby, I thought we said we'd meet at the spa. Little

 change of plans. Carlos knows. About us? Yeah. Can I stay with

 you for a while? Of course. Thank you. Girls, come on. Go
