 ":"Previously

 on Desperate Housewives... Will you do me the honor of moving in

 with me? Proposals were made. I think starting an interior design business

 is... It's genius. Juanita learned the truth. You're not my mommy. She

 told me about this guy that she had a fling with. Susan

 revealed she knew a secret. His name was Tom Scavo. - That

 is none of your damn business. - I am Lynette's friend, and

 I'm not gonna stand by and watch you screw up her marriage.

 And when a neighborhood protest got violent... Get off the car! Juanita

 was saved... Susan was hurt... And later, someone... got revenge. Something happened

 in the suburbs last night. A man was shot outside his home.

 Detectives were called to investigate. And they soon learned this man had

 enemies. Detectives, I'm an expert marksman. If I'd been aiming for Paul

 Young, he'd be dead. I have no idea who shot Paul. All

 I know is I need a chiropractor for all the cartwheels I've

 been doing. If you find out who did it, let me know.

 I wanna send them flowers. Yes, the police had many suspects in

 the shooting of Paul Young. But his wife... had only one. I

 was surprised you wanted to see me. Our last visit ended less

 than... pleasantly. Are you here to apologize? You know exactly why I'm

 here. No, I don't. Obviously, you didn't do it yourself. So who

 did you hire? Beth, I don't know what you're talking about. Paul's

 been shot. What? Is he dead? Sorry. He's in the hospital. -

 When did this happen? - Stop it, mama. Just stop it. I

 know you had something to do with this. Beth, you have to

 believe me. I don't know anything about it. You're a liar. Look,

 I'm not going to pretend I don't hate the man. I do.

 But my goal all along has been to prove that he murdered

 my sister. Why would I have him killed before I could do

 that? Then who shot him? I don't know. I don't know what

 to believe anymore. I have to go to the hospital. Word on

 the yard is that you can get me a clean cell phone.

 For a price. Get it. Somebody's been a naughty boy. I guess

 you changed your mind about that... proposal I made. Don't get me

 wrong. I'm thrilled. I just wish you'd waited till I gave you

 the signal. Yes, Paul Young had enemies. I can't talk right now.

 More than he knew. Par la Wisteria Team www.wisteria-team.fr www.sous-titres.eu It's something

 we need to be reminded of whenever our world has been turned

 upside down. Come the morning, life goes on. We pull ourselves together

 and go on shopping sprees... Or reignite a love affair... Or go

 back to work. Yes, we must remember life will get better... Unless

 it doesn't. You took out my kidney? It had ruptured. You were

 bleeding internally. We had no choice. But you can get by on

 one kidney, right? Usually. But in your case, it's a little more

 complicated. The other one is deformed. Well, fine. I won't enter it

 in any kidney beauty contests. The point is, it's only operating at

 about 5%. If that number drops any lower, you're at serious risk

 of renal failure. How do I not know this? I've never had

 any serious health problems. That's because the other kidney was doing such

 a great job of taking up the slack. You mean the one

 you took? So what are you saying? Do I need a transplant?

 Eventually. But we need to get you on dialysis. That requires a

 minor surgical procedure to install an AV shunt, Slow down. You said

 \"If it goes any lower\". Maybe it won't. Maybe it'll go up.

 Anything is possible. But you need to come to terms with the

 reality of what's happened to you. Your life has changed. I have

 some information here on dialysis. I suggest you read it... today. Welcome

 to Miss Charlotte's Doll Academy. I'm Miss Charlotte. How can I serve

 you today? We are here to buy a doll. I'm sorry. We

 don't sell dolls here. Really? This place got creepy fast. But I

 do let good little girls adopt some of my friends. Are you

 ready to be a mommy? I don't care. She's kidding. She would

 love a doll, and I wanna do something special for her birthday.

 So let's get this adoption going. Very good. I have someone in

 our royalty cabinet I'd love for you to meet. Look, I am

 sorry about everything you've been through the past few days. But I'm

 trying to show you how much I love you. Can't you meet

 me halfway? This is Lady Catherine. She's the toast of Buckingham Palace.

 The trim on her cloak is real ermine. Isn't she gorgeous? I'll

 go prepare her papers. Are you happy, sweetie? Let me get my

 phone out so I can take a picture of my two princesses.

 Why are you looking at Grace? I wasn't. I was... I must

 have scrolled too far. Why do you have that picture? And what

 name shall I put under \"mother\"? Put whatever you want. I hate

 this stupid place. Juanita, wait! I heard about your kidney. And I

 just want you to know I have two. So let's talk deal.

 Relax. I'm not telling Lynette. You're not? Thing about having something like

 this happen to you... You start to think about what's important and

 what's not. And I realized it's not up to me to tell

 Lynette about something that happened 20 years ago. Thank God. It's up

 to you. You okay? You've been standing out here for, like, 20

 minutes. I saw Susan at the hospital. How's she doing? She's not

 gonna tell Lynette about our 20-year-old mistake. Thank God. What a relief!

 Why aren't you relieved? There's one thing she said I can't get

 out of my head. If I never tell Lynette what happened, then

 my friendship with her is not real. Sure it's real. All my

 life, people I thought were my friends have left me. People from

 college, friends I had with Doug... They're all gone. And Lynette stayed.

 I think I owe her the truth. Sometimes being a friend requires

 you to lie. Come on. We've all seen McCluskey in those jogging

 shorts and yelled, \"Lookin' good!\" That's being a friend. You can't tell

 Lynette. She would be devastated. I know. I just have to live

 with what that says about me. Great. We got a plan. Thought

 you might want a cold root beer to cool you down. I

 like the \"cold\" and \"beer\" part. I know living with a woman

 who doesn't drink... It must be torture. How's the replanting coming? That's

 taking a little while. Yard got pretty messed up by the riot.

 I'll work on the sprinklers later. There's no rush. Look who's drinking

 out of the bottle. See what you've done to me? The next

 thing you know, I'll be flossing only once a day. You started

 unpacking my stuff? Your books are on the shelf. Sports trophies are

 in the den. And on a sad note, your beanbag chair accidentally

 ripped when I stuck a knife in it and stuffed it in

 the trash. My lava lamp? Accidentally broke when I pushed it off

 the counter. Man, my stuff is clumsy. I may not love all

 your things, but I love that you're here. Everything that happened over

 the last few days made me realize how important you are to

 me. Steer manure's not your favorite aphrodisiac? Slightly worse than your aftershave,

 accidentally poured down the drain. Hold your breath. I'm kissing you anyway.

 There is a God. - Can I help you? - Someone to

 see you. Judy kicked me out. Can I stay here with you?

 I never saw it coming. One minute, Judy and I were enjoying

 a nice Pinot Noir, and the next, she was wheeling me to

 the cab, and telling me it was over. That's terrible. Don't you

 worry. You can stay here with us. Are you sure? I mean,

 I had no idea that Keith had just moved in with you.

 You're a new couple. The last thing you need around here is

 a third and... fourth wheel. Nonsense. We insist. Stay as long as

 you want. Isn't that right, Keith? Yeah. Sure. Any idea how long

 that might be? I just want to know how long we'll be

 enjoying his company. I gather as soon as I can find a

 new place to live and a caregiver. Would you mind backing up

 a bit? Your cologne is making my eyes water. Actually, it's steer

 manure. To each his own. Why don't you go shower? And I'll

 get Orson settled. Would you like some tea? No. I'm fine. So...

 Keith. Interesting choice. Just... sort of happened. But moving in together? Aren't

 you taking this rebound relationship a little too seriously? It's not a

 rebound relationship. What Keith and I have is very... special. And I

 know what you're thinking. He is a bit young. Not at all.

 I notice he has all of his big boy teeth. - But

 he and I have a lot in common. - Really? I'm just...

 curious. Which Lil Wayne song is your favorite? \"Fo Sheezy\" or \"Ask

 Them Hoes\"? Joke if you must, but I am not the woman

 you once knew. I have changed, and Keith is responsible. I'm wondering

 why would someone change something that was already perfect? God, I never

 thought we'd have a kid in therapy. Well, I did. I just

 thought it'd be Celia. I wish we weren't doing this. The shrink

 always blames the mother. - The husband blames the mother, too. -

 How many times - do I have to say I'm sorry? -

 You know? It is not about us anymore. Juanita's world's collapsing around

 her, and the only thing that I care about is healing the

 damage that's been done to that poor little girl. I took her

 doll shopping. Juanita, if you'd like to go through the magazines, I'll

 talk to your mom and dad for a minute. Obviously, this is

 a very... unusual situation. Juanita understands now that her birth parents are

 Hector and Carmen. But she feels nothing for them. And because of

 that, she doesn't understand why you feel so much for Grace. It's

 a different love. It doesn't mean we love her any less. What

 should we do? Remove Grace from your life. We told you. She's

 already gone. Juanita says there are photos of her. Her artwork is

 on your refrigerator. You're saying get rid of all that. Once Juanita

 feels she is again the most important thing in your life, she

 will start to heal. Obviously, I want to help my daughter. But

 all the photos? We'll do whatever it takes. Good. So we canvassed

 your neighborhood to determine if anyone had any motive. They all did.

 But so far, all of them have an alibi. So... what's the

 next step? We'd like to ask Mrs. Young a few questions. What

 kind of questions? We'd like to know where exactly you were when

 your husband was shot, and... I'll stop you right there. My wife

 is not a suspect in this investigation. She is the one person

 in that whole corrupt, backstabbing street that I can trust. Is there

 anyone else who might harbor a grudge against you - or wish

 you harm in any way? - Not that I can think of.

 What about you, Mrs. Young? No one I can think of. Then,

 if you can think of anyone, please let us know. Did you

 catch the look on the wife's face? What? What are these photos

 of Grace still doing here? Right. Sorry. You should have gotten rid

 of these when we got back from the doctor's. I've been busy.

 Here, give them to me. - What will you do with them?

 - Hide them in the closet. No. We have to throw these

 away. Why? Juanita could find them. She and Celia play in your

 closet. I'll put them in our safety deposit box. The girls don't

 play at the bank. Why are you not taking this seriously? Dr.

 Lunt never said we had to throw Grace's photos in the trash.

 She said we have to remove Grace from our lives. You understand

 what that means? As far as we are concerned, Grace no longer

 exists. Now give me your phone, please. - Why? - To delete

 every photo of Grace. - You can't be serious. - Juanita is

 in pain! Do you not get that? She is no longer a

 happy little girl because you did not protect her! So what am

 I supposed to do? Just pretend Grace doesn't exist? And that is

 the last time you'll mention her name in this house! Please, no

 more meds. I'm good for what ails ya. I need to look

 at you. No, I need to hug you. How's my girl? Hear

 you're about a half-pound lighter. They told you about the kidney? But

 it's gonna be okay. We're gonna get through this. Dialysis is not

 as bad as it sounds. I'm not doing dialysis. It's like six

 hours a day, four times a week. There's not enough gossip rags

 to fill up that kind of time. Plus, I have a job

 and a kid to raise. - But the doctor said... - Mike,

 you know what? The doctors don't know everything. Look at this. There's

 herbal remedies and alternative diets. There's other ways to handle this than

 being hooked up to a machine. I feel great. And I just

 want to handle this my own way. I'd feel a lot better

 if you'd listen to the doctors. And I'd feel a lot better

 if I had your support. God, I can't believe you're back. So

 the overall approach is craftsman, but with Japanese accents, including the lighting....

 The vases, the calligraphy. The two styles... Work perfectly together. And for

 your hotel, we think it would look... Just gorgeous. Well, I usually

 run everything past my board... But not this time. I love it.

 And I love the way you two are so in sync. We

 should be. We've been best friends for 25 years. Well, actually, 26.

 You can tell. So, let's see what you have in mind for

 the lighting. Keep talking. I'm gonna go get the water pitcher, 'cause

 the waiter won't refill my glass. So... the lighting. I have a

 company that does these Japanese paper lanterns. They're beautiful. And you know

 we have other hotels. So we may need some more conversations. Look

 what I found next to the water pitcher. - Oatmeal raisin. -

 She's always been crazy about them. Remember freshman year, when you broke

 up with that boyfriend? I kept her on a steady diet of

 these and tequila for two weeks. The bar is one of my

 favorite areas. Those lanterns with these... Are you okay? It's just... Oatmeal

 raisin. You've been such a good friend to me. Relax! There was,

 like, a hundred of 'em on a tray. So, take the drawings

 home. Live with them. And we will check in next week. Renee,

 are you... Yeah, no, she's fine. She's fine. We'll call you next

 week. And thank you so much. We are so excited. What the

 hell? I have to tell you something. 20 years ago... I did

 something awful. God, who cares? Ten minutes ago, you did something amazing.

 I slept with Tom. When? It was that weekend you went to

 visit your parents. And it was just the one time, and it

 meant nothing. And I've been carrying this around ever since I moved

 here. And it's been eating me up. That was after we were

 engaged. Yeah, but you had... broken up... for the week. I'm so

 sorry. I don't want to hear it. In fact, I can't even

 look at you right now. I can't even... be in the same

 room as you right now. But you are my ride, so let's

 go. - Do you hate me? - Shut up. - I just

 need to... - Shut up. I hate you... A lot. But I

 do foresee a day far in the future when I might only

 hate you a little. You know what the worst part is? For

 the last 20 years, you two have been walking around knowing this,

 and... I... didn't. I'm such an idiot. You're not, you're not. And

 I am so sorry... My God, you really need to stop saying

 that. But I do need you to do me a favor. Anything.

 Don't tell Tom we talked about this. Why? You slept with my

 husband. Can we leave it at \"'cause I said so\"? Hi. We

 haven't met yet. I'm Tina's mother. Juanita came to our house last

 week. - Right. Thanks for coming. - Of course. I know, you

 want some cake. Hold on, we'll get you some. - Sorry. That's

 my youngest, Celia. - She's adorable. Do you have any other children?

 I don't have any other children. I am finally home. And just

 so you know, I had the worst day ever. Did you? I

 had to meet with one surly client after another. Our computers went

 down. I spilled coffee on my shoe. Sounds like you went through

 a lot. But I'm much better now. I forgot to ask... How

 did the pitch go? Good. We got the job. That is fantastic!

 You guys are just getting started, and you're already kicking ass! I

 am so proud of you! Well, it was mostly Renee. She did

 the lion's share of the work. She's an amazing woman. Everything okay?

 Yes, of course. I... I made some hot chocolate for the kids.

 Would you like some? That sounds great. Might be a little cold.

 Do you want me to heat it up? No. It's okay. -

 It's boiling! - Is it? I burned my tongue! Oh, I'm sorry.

 Here we are. You didn't. Coq au vin? I know it's your

 favorite, considering the rough few days... You are amazing. Good, you're here.

 We can eat. What that? I thought we were having sloppy joes.

 Since we're having a guest, I thought I'd serve something more elegant.

 You know what? Tomorrow night, you and I should make our bouillabaisse.

 Of course. Keith, you'll love it. If it's French for \"sloppy joes\",

 then have at it. Bree, this looks wonderful. If I may. \"Show

 me another pleasure like dinner \"which comes every day and lasts an

 hour.\" Talleyrand. \"Shut up and eat, varmints!\" Yosemite Sam. This is quite

 a thrill. I didn't know Stanley Kowalski was joining us for dinner.

 Is he a friend of you guys? Actually... It's a character in

 A Streetcar Named Desire. He wore a lot of t-shirts and... You

 probably haven't heard of that cause Will Ferrell hasn't done a remake.

 Why don't you go up and put a shirt on? After all,

 it is dinner, and we do have company. If it's all the

 same to everyone, I'm comfortable. Why don't I just go up and

 grab you one? Sit. Please. I'm sure our company can endure one

 night of bare arms. Quite right. Though I don't know what the

 fuss is. Seems like such a reasonable request. Guess I just like

 dressing the way I want to dress in my own home. Why

 don't you take off your jacket, see how much more comfortable it

 is? If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer not to.

 Aren't you afraid of getting food on it? Not really. I'm planning

 on eating with utensils, not my hands. Accidents happen. I suppose I

 should be happy it wasn't his own feces. Orson, I'm so sorry.

 Keith, what were you thinking? Let's just put this behind us, yeah?

 And enjoy the lovely meal that you've prepared. And please pass the

 peas. Stop it this instant! You're acting like children. And I will

 not stand for it! Do you hear me?! I'm sorry to just

 come over here without calling, but I need to speak with you.

 Come in. How's Orson? You know he's staying with me? Figured as

 much. I need a favor. It's just too difficult for Orson to

 live with me and my new boyfriend, and I know you broke

 up with him... Is there any way he could stay here until

 he finds a new place? I don't know what he's been telling

 you, but Orson left me. What? Why? Because he's still in love

 with you. Beautiful, isn't she? She's just perfect. I'll take her. I

 must say, your daughter's a lucky little girl. My daughter? I assumed

 you were buying her a present. This is for me. I'm really

 sorry about last night. But there is something about your ex... I

 get it. You had a relationship. It's over. It's totally platonic, and

 I'm cool with it. Actually, I just spoke with his ex-girlfriend. Orson

 is still in love with me. I knew it. I knew it.

 Let's wheel his ass to the curb. Keith, calm down. Before we

 wheel his anywhere, I need to talk to him. I'm sure I

 can get him to make other arrangements. Now. I don't want that

 guy in our home another night. Fine. Just give me 15 minutes.

 I spoke with Judy. She told me that you were the one

 who left... Because you still have feelings for me. Is that true?

 Is that why you're here? Leaving you was the biggest mistake I

 could have made. I know that now. Tell me you don't feel

 the same way. Just tell me you feel nothing, and I will

 go away. I promise. Do you know how easy it would be

 for me... to become that woman again? To slide back into the

 role of your wife? Then do it. We have a connection, Bree,

 and you know it. We used to. I've made a new connection.

 Please, with that tattooed Neanderthal? I will always have feelings for you,

 but I've changed. How have you changed? I can't articulate it to

 you because I don't understand it myself. All I know is that

 being with Keith has made me a different person. I don't believe

 it. You will always have a piece of my heart, but you

 have to understand that this is over. I'm not giving up. I'm

 not. Did you tell him? Does he need help packing his stuff?

 Actually, he's gonna be staying with us a little longer. Just for

 a few more days until he finds a place of his own.

 He's very fragile right now. I don't believe this. I can't just

 throw him out. Because you don't want to. It's not your fault

 you're still in love with him. Wait! Please stop and talk to

 me! Bree, there's nothing to talk about! Why would you wanna be

 with sloppy Joe when you can be with coq au vin in

 there? Let's just cut our losses. You listen to me. That's who

 I was, not who I am now. I have never worked harder

 in my life to keep a relationship, and if I have to

 sit in a pile of steer manure to prove it to you,

 then I'll do it! Mike, just hang up. I don't wanna deal

 with any more doctors. He's a top kidney specialist. I really want

 you to talk to him. I can't get any reception in here.

 I'm gonna go downstairs. MJ, take care of your mom. Mom, this

 pudding's gross. I wish they had ice cream. I think they do

 in the cafeteria downstairs. When your dad comes back, maybe he can

 take you. How much longer are you gonna be in the hospital?

 I don't know. A little longer. Is a kidney like a heart?

 Do you need it to live? So you could die? You know

 what? Why don't you and I go down to the cafeteria right

 now and get you some ice cream? Mrs. Delfino, you're in no

 condition to be getting out of bed. - Just taking him for

 ice cream. - Let me get you a wheelchair. I don't need

 a wheelchair. Look, I need to do this. He's scared. So how

 long till you're able to play basketball with me? Not too long.

 Trust me, sweetie. I can't wait to kick your butt in a

 little game of one-on-one. Are you okay? Sure. So, what kind of

 ice cream do you want, sweetie? Can I have an ice cream

 sandwich? You bet. You know what's cool? When I was at my

 friend Jerry's birthday party, we made our own ice cream and put

 graham crackers in it. That sounds great. You know what else was

 cool? On St. Patrick's Day at school, they gave us green ice

 cream. There were green M&M's in it. Everyone else thought it was

 gross. So you're having surgery to put in a shunt. It's for

 the dialysis. How long will you need to have this? Till they

 find me a donor. That won't take very long, will it? Three

 to five years. It's weird. I'm going through this whole thing like

 it was a movie. It was happening to someone else. But now...

 it's real. So I need to ask you guys something. Of course.

 What is it? If something happens to me... I need to know

 if you'll be there to help... Mike with MJ. Honey, you'll come

 through this with flying colors. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Absolutely. We'll

 be there. My hero. Save it. I had nothing to do with

 what happened. Could you do me a favor next time? A little

 down and to the right. There's not gonna be a next time.

 There wasn't a this time. I thought you said you'd think about

 it. That's what you said, and I told you \"no\". I didn't

 do it. Then who did? Something happened in the suburbs last week.

 A man was shot outside his home. Detectives were called to investigate...

 and they soon learned this man had enemies... Some he was not

 even aware of. Sorry to disturb you again. Not at all. Any

 luck with the investigation? - Is your wife here? - She's in

 the cafeteria. Do you mind? It's a bit of a delicate matter.

 What? Sir, when we questioned you about any enemies you might have,

 you didn't mention your mother-in-law. My mother-in-law? What are you talking about?

 We did a little checking into your wife's background. Why didn't you

 tell us her mother framed you for her own murder? I mean,

 come on. We know she's in jail. But Felicia Tillman has gone

 to some extraordinary lengths to cause you harm. Are you sure there

 isn't a possibility that she somehow was involved in this? Not at

 all. That's water under the bridge. With love and prayer, Felicia and

 I have resolved the issues between us. We'll let you know. I

 appreciate it. Thank you for not bringing this up in front of
