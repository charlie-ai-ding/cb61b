 ":"[Mary

 Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives: A reporter did a story on homeless

 teens. My son was one of them. - Oh, my God. -

 Orson found Andrew. Have I done stuff for money that I'm not

 proud of? Yeah, sure. And the prodigal son returned. Mike fell into

 a coma. - What could be more romantic? - I can think

 of something. And Susan fell into the arms of another man... ...

 a bit too soon. The day Mike Delfino woke from his coma,

 Edie Britt was the first to know. Once she was sure he

 was responsive... Mike? [screaming] ... Edie decided to share the good news

 with others. Code red! Code red! My friend just woke up from

 his coma. And that is how word began to spread. Mike's physician,

 Dr. Craig, was busy with a patient when he first heard the

 news. Not long after, he called his Aunt Ida, who was busy

 knitting a sweater. She told Lynette Scavo, who was busy watering her

 lawn. And she told her husband Tom, who was busy playing a

 computer game. He then e-mailed his friend Carlos, who was busy plotting

 strategy with his divorce lawyer. And Carlos called his soon-to-be-ex-wife, Gabrielle, who

 was busy doing the same with hers. Yes, word of Mike's miraculous

 recovery spread quickly throughout Wisteria Lane and stopped cold everyone's busy, busy

 life. Everyone, that is, except for Susan Mayer, who was busy doing

 something she would soon wish she hadn't. [Mary Alice] Edward Sibley was

 the beloved founder of the town of Fairview. Prior to that, he

 was best known as a bootlegger... ... a womanizer and a horse

 thief. Of course, no one remembers those parts of Edward's past. Luckily

 for him, history is designed to be rewritten. And no one knew

 this better than Bree Hodge. So, you're just gonna lie to people?

 Not a lie, just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where

 you've been. We can't tell them you've been living on skid row

 sleeping in a cardboard box. So why do I have to go

 to this history fair anyway? It's just some dumb school contest. Danielle's

 not gonna win. - She never wins anything. - Is it weird

 eating off plates? You could eat straight out of the garbage. This

 is a family event and we're all gonna enjoy it together. Stop

 sniping and start thinking of an alibi for your brother. We could

 say he joined a cult and we had to kidnap and deprogram

 him. Well, that would spare the family some embarrassment. Why not throw

 in a killing spree, too? Well, here's a thought. We say he

 was at drama camp. It reflects Andrew's interest in the performing arts,

 while giving us a private joke to savor about the drama of

 his estrangement. Uh, yeah, he is always like that. Uh, guys, why

 can't we just tell the truth? I got out of line, you

 kicked me out, I lived on the street, I came back home.

 We'll need a name for this drama camp. We got ties here,

 people. Designer ties, two for a dollar. Ooh. Do you like those

 barbells? Make me an offer. I'm feeling generous. [tires screeching] Here's the

 customer I've been waiting for. Carlos, I see you got my flier.

 A garage sale featuring menswear and sporting equipment. I need cash. And

 you don't expect me to sell my stuff, do you? Those are

 my good cuff links. Those are my CDs. Oh, my God. This

 is my baby blanket. My mama knitted this. And it pains me

 to sell it. It's just my lawyer told me what you're offering

 and I can't get by on that. I am doing the best

 I can. I got deals in the pipeline. - I'm not making

 as much as I used to. - So I should be punished?

 Attention! For the next 20 minutes, free golf club with every purchase.

 Gabby, I'm trying to be civil. But if you don't knock it

 off right now, the gloves are coming off. Honey, the gloves aren't

 just off, they're 70%% off. Get your cashmere gloves! Hey, Parker. Where's

 your uniform? You got your game in an hour. No, I don't.

 I quit. - What? - I hate baseball. Daddy said I don't

 have to play it anymore. Daddy should have checked with Mommy, so

 she could have a chance to tell him why he's wrong. Hey,

 you're playing. But, Mom, I suck. Everybody says so. - They made

 up a fake position for me. - It is not fake. There

 is not a team that could get along without their backup far

 right fielder. OK, come on. Let's go practice. [groaning] All right, let's

 try it again. Nice and easy. Watch the ball, hit the bat.

 You ready? You can do it. Here we go. OK, Parker, I

 keep telling you, you gotta keep your eyes open. - How are

 you gonna hit the ball? - You threw it too fast. Throw

 slower. If I threw any slower, we would be bowling. Hey. Hey,

 what you guys doing? I'll tell you what we're not doing, quitting.

 - Hey, buddy. Did you change your mind? - No. I told

 him that he didn't have to play anymore. He's got five more

 games. He made a commitment. He's gonna see it through. But he

 doesn't like it. And if you haven't noticed, he kind of sucks.

 What message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the

 going gets rough? It's a way to kill three hours before they

 eat pizza. Why are you being such a hard-ass? It's called parenting.

 Watch and learn. OK, P-Dog, this is a curve ball. - [thumping]

 - [Parker] Ow! Again, opening the eyes. Can't stress it enough. -

 Sure it's OK if we stay another day? - Let's see. What

 excuse did we use when we had this conversation yesterday? - We

 work hard and we deserve to relax. - That was last Thursday's

 rationale. - Fresh air is good for us? - Tuesday. Here's one.

 Julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father. - Brilliant.

 - [laughing] If we keep this up, we could stay here till

 Christmas. Sometimes when you smile like that, it really makes me think

 that... What? What were you gonna say? It makes me think that

 I could love you. I don't mean love in the swooning schoolboy

 sense, you know, fireworks exploding, bells ringing. To me, it's about this,

 a mundane task that's suddenly a joy because of who you're doing

 it with. That's love to me. Someone to fluff while you fold,

 someone to whisper to at a boring party, to... Shh. Do you

 mind? You're kind of drowning out the bells. So I am. -

 I think I can feed myself now. - Mmm. You said that

 yesterday and I wound up with a cleavage full of pudding. You

 heard the therapist. It's gonna be weeks before you're up and running.

 I just wanna get home, unpack. You just let home come to

 you, OK? The whole street's dying to see you. Bree is even

 bakin' you a peach pie. She's the redhead, right? Right. Husband's the

 doctor. Rex. Rex is dead. Really? When did that happen? - About

 a year and a half ago. - What? - Yeah. You were

 at his funeral. - What are you talking about? That's not possible.

 I just met him right before my accident. Mike, what year is

 it? 2004. Why? It's called retrograde memory loss. It's caused by the

 swelling and frontal-Iobe damage. You say he's lost two whole years? Yeah.

 Is that unusual? Well, patients more typically lose several weeks. The damage

 may be more severe than we thought. Do you think he'll get

 his memory back? He might. At least partially. You could be some

 assistance with that. - How? - Bring him some personal belongings. Photos,

 letters. He's gonna need some help to remember what he can't. Well,

 I'm sure I could fill in a few blanks. - [chattering] -

 [applause] [cheering] Did I tell you that Burnham Fox is looking for

 a new creative director? PR? What makes you think I wanna work

 for a PR firm? Easy hours, big paycheck, access to great parties.

 What was I thinking? Honey, we agreed that I would chase my

 dream. - That ain't it. - I was just making conversation. -

 Batter up. - [boy] Is he up? [boy 2] Oh, come on.

 Come on, Parker. Keep your eye on the ball. - Strike one.

 - [groaning] Hey, people. He's just a kid, OK? Come on. -

 Strike two. - [crowd booing] Hey, hey. That is not helpful. It

 only takes one, Parker. Only takes one. It's not your son's fault.

 He's up against the best pitcher in the league. - That guy's

 a machine. Who is that kid? - Nicky Abbott. He's a neighbor

 of mine. Kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old. - Strike three.

 You're out. - [crowd groaning] I'm gonna go buy him an ice

 cream. It's OK, P-Dog. You're gonna get 'em the next inning. So,

 tell me, what else do you know about this Nicky kid? -

 You're short 50 cents. - Please. That's all I got. Hey. Give

 the kid what he wants. Thanks. Hey, aren't you Parker Scavo's mom?

 That's right. Come. Walk with me. - So, money's a little tight,

 huh? - A little. Yeah, I heard your old man's outta work.

 That's gotta be tough. Yeah. They cut my allowance. No. A kid's

 gotta have an allowance. How else are you gonna buy the things

 you want, right? Like that cotton candy. That's a little piece of

 heaven, huh? Hey, I got an idea. We could help each other

 out. My son's having trouble hitting the ball. - Yeah, I saw

 that. - Yeah. Ever seen one of these? Carlos, what are you

 doing here, besides lowering my property value? I had news and I

 wanted to see your face when I delivered it. Oh. I'm tired

 of fighting, so I called my lawyer and told him to give

 in to your demands for spousal support. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Wow.

 Well, thank you. OK, you've seen my face. Now you can beat

 it. Wait, there's more. Since I'm gonna be giving you all that

 money, I have to cut back on some stuff, like the rent

 on my apartment. The good news is, according to my lawyer, I'm

 completely within my rights to do this. Honey, I'm home. Wait. You

 can't stay here. Now there's the face that I was looking for.

 [umpire] Batter up. - Strike one. - [crowd groaning] Wow. That was

 kinda slow. His arm must be getting tired. Yeah, well, after all

 those fastballs. Come on, Parker. You can do it. - Strike two.

 - [crowd groaning] Oh, my God! [crowd gasping] [indistinct chattering] Mr. Faladi,

 thank you for getting Danielle interested in history. She has never worked

 so hard on a project before. Well, don't tell anyone, but she

 is my favorite student. And it's so good to see that Andrew's

 back. Where's he been all this time? Drama camp. A very prestigious

 drama camp. - Do I know you? - Yeah. Uh, you gave

 me a ride in your black sedan once. You know, the one

 with the reclining seats? Excuse me. Wasn't that Dr. Keck? You know

 him? Yeah. Yeah. We, uh, met at drama camp. Oh, good Lord.

 You mean y...? Yeah. I, uh... performed for him once. - Are

 you all right? - I'll be all right. I'm fine. Howard Keck?

 You sure? I mean, he's a very respected member of the community.

 Yeah, well, they all were. What were you and Andrew talking about

 today, at the fair? Uh... nothing. I was gonna make some cocoa.

 Would you like some? Orson, I saw the two of you whispering

 right after Dr. Keck ran off. What happened? Look, Andrew asked me

 not to say anything, but I don't want there to be any

 secrets between us, so... - Please don't let him know I told

 you. - Well, of course not. What is it? How to put

 this, uh... When Andrew was on the street, he, uh, he didn't

 just beg for money. At times he... well, he did things to

 earn it. Good. I mean, I'd hate to think he had no

 work ethic at all. What I mean is, men hired him to...

 ...do things, things he wasn't very proud of. - Yard work? -

 Afraid not. Orson, you're scaring me. Did he do something awful? No.

 No, not awful. I mean, people do it all the time. I

 do it with you. I just don't pay you for it. [gasping]

 I think someone could use a cocoa. [machine blowing steam] Look, we

 mustn't judge Andrew. He was desperate. I'll never forgive myself. It's all

 my fault for pushing him away. Bree, don't do that to yourself.

 The important thing is he's home and safe. How does Dr. Keck

 fit into this? Is he treating Andrew for some awful disease? Actually,

 I think he was one of Andrew's... clients. Howard Keck? That's ridiculous.

 He's got a wife and a daughter. He plays on Tom Scavo's

 bowling team. Well, it's clearly not the only team he plays for.

 This is a nightmare. An absolute nightmare. Please don't cut into that

 pie. I made it for Mike. Mike... Delfino? Yes, I left you

 two messages. Didn't you check? He woke up from his coma. Oh,

 God. - Is it Sharla Banning? - I'm not telling who it

 is. I'm just asking the question. If you know a husband has

 been unfaithful, do you tell the wife? Absolutely. He could bring home

 a disease. That's how Bunny Conners got Chlamydia. [gasps] She said it

 was from wearing someone's bathing suit. No, that's how she got crabs.

 Poor Bunny, it's always something. If not the clap, it's a botched

 face lift. Be that as it may, do we all agree that

 I should tell this man's wife? I wouldn't. Women always say they

 wanna know and they always resent the person who tells them. -

 If Tom cheated, you wouldn't tell me? - No. But I would

 hire someone to beat the crap out of him. Aww. You're sweet.

 Bree, I think you gotta follow your heart on this one. Even

 if it isn't the easiest thing to do. Gabby... are you and

 Carlos getting back together? Why? Uh... Would you excuse me? Carlos, what

 are you doing? I told you I was having friends over. I'm

 thirsty. And this is my kitchen, too. Hey, ladies. - For God's

 sakes, put some pants on. - I wanted to. Somebody threw my

 laundry out of the dryer while it was wet. - You deserved

 it. - What are you talking about? - You peed in my

 shampoo. Admit it. - What? The cap was loose and I know

 how your sick mind works. Really? In that case, you should know

 that I wouldn't do it to your shampoo. I would do it

 to your mouthwash, soup and decaffeinated coffee. Ladies. To answer your question,

 no, we are not getting back together. [French music playing] I love

 this music. What's it about? Making love. Regret. Cigarettes. - Cigarettes? -

 I assume. It's French. They write what they know. I'd love to

 go to France someday. - [turns off music] - Would you like

 to go next month? - Are you serious? - I'm going on

 business. Come with me. Ian, I just took a week off. I

 couldn't possibly justify taking another. You'll manage. We've proven ourselves masters of

 the flimsy rationalization. Well, OK. You gotta promise me we'll actually leave

 the hotel room. It's Paris, dear. You can pretty much make love

 anywhere. [cell phone ringing] - I thought you didn't get reception. -

 The occasional signal gets through. Please don't answer. Oh, it's Julie. I

 have to. Hello. What's up? Hey... Uh, I can't... No, can you

 say that again? The signal's really bad. What? Oh, my God. -

 Is something wrong? - Mike woke up. Um, Julie, when did he

 w... - Julie? Julie? - [phone cuts off] Oh, damn it! Oh,

 my God. Oh, my God. Um... I... I have to go. Um,

 I gotta get out of here. Yes, of course. I think that

 you're sitting on my bra. - What'd the coach say? - Parker's

 off the team. - That's not fair. It's not his fault. -

 It doesn't matter. Because his mother bribed an eight-year-old pitcher, who also,

 by the way, was kicked off of his team. Not Nicky, too?

 What were you thinking? I was trying to repair my son's shattered

 self-esteem. With a 50? Honey, everything would have been fine if you'd

 just let Parker quit. Well, excuse me for not wanting my son

 to be a quitter. Yeah, 'cause I guess having two in the

 family would be a bit much. Whoa. Where'd that come from? You

 say that you support my decision to leave advertising, but it is

 obvious that you resent it. That is not true. Why do you

 keep dropping hints about the job at Burnham Fox, then? I figured,

 since you're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is,

 you might make a few bucks in the meantime. I have a

 dream too. It includes keeping this house. Like I don't... - Are

 you fighting? - No. No. It was excitement. We have just decided

 you don't have to play baseball anymore. - Isn't that great? -

 But I can't stop now. - Huh? - Not when I'm finally

 getting good. You were right, Mom. I just need a little more

 practice. Let's go practice. See you outside. So, what's on the next

 page of your parenting handbook? - Ian, can you please hurry? -

 I am hurrying. - We should be on the road. - It's

 not like checking out of a hotel. There's doors to secure, I

 have to turn the gas off. - Can't you do that later?

 - When it's overrun by raccoons? The joke'll be on them when

 it blows up. Mike is awake, he's lying there and he's wondering

 where I am. Yes, I get it. You're in a hurry. Just

 please give me a minute. I bet you'd move faster if Jane

 were awake. Here's the picture that you took of me in my

 bikini at that pool party. You could have warned me I was

 showing a little nip. Oh. Susan Mayer. Remember her? Yeah. She's pretty.

 Yeah, she is sorta in this picture. Is there a date on

 this thing? The nurses said that she visited me a lot. -

 We were close, huh? - You have just come out of a

 coma. Can we not talk about Susan till you start to regain

 your strength? Why? Oh, God. I hate to be the one telling

 you this. - Well, if you don't want to... - That tramp

 treated you like dirt. She strung you along, she slept with other

 guys. You broke up with her twice. Then why did she keep

 visiting me when I was out of it? Well, she's a bit

 of a stalker. I was worried that she was gonna disconnect one

 of the tubes. But don't worry, she's glommed onto some new guy,

 and she's up in the mountains at his place with him right

 now. Wow. She told the nurses that she really loved me. That's

 the one thing about Susan that you must never forget. She is

 a liar. - You waiting to see Mike Delfino? - Uh... Yes.

 I'm a... I'm a neighbor. But he has a visitor, so I'll

 come back later. He may not recognize you. He's suffered significant memory

 loss. Really? That's too bad. Sure you don't wanna go in? Ms.

 Britt won't mind. No, I've waited this long. I can wait a

 bit longer. Gabby? - Hey, Carlos. What's up? - My key won't

 work. That's probably because I had the locks changed. - Gabby. -

 Can't be too safe. You never know when someone might move in

 on you when you're not looking. Hello, 911? There's an intruder breaking

 into my home. [glass breaking] Can you tell them to come armed?

 I think he's Mexican. I'm telling you. I'm her husband. I bought

 her this house. My name is on the deed. If you're married,

 it's a matter of public record. I can find out quickly. All

 right. We're going through a messy divorce, and he moved back in

 on me. The wife keeps the house and the husband gets the

 crappy apartment. It's the American way. Call my lawyer. This is legal.

 She knows it. She's trying to get back at me. I hear

 that. You wouldn't believe the stuff my wife pulled when we split.

 Whoa! You can't take sides. Police officers aren't allowed to take sides.

 I pay your salary. Ted, you see that? This lady just assaulted

 me. Oh... [scoffs] It was a swat. Ted, does this hurt? Get

 your hands off me. Police brutality! [car engine starting] This is all

 my fault. Why punish Parker? Sorry, Mrs. Scavo. Rules are rules. I

 can't put him back on the team. Just one more game, he'll

 suck, the other kids will taunt him. He'll wanna quit again. See,

 everybody wins. - Wish I could help, but... - Please. You can't

 bend the rules just once? You know, the team could use some

 new batting helmets. - You're asking for a bribe? - You pretending

 you're above that? I'll get my checkbook. Hello, Vera. I made you

 some of those shortbread biscuits that you like so much. How sweet.

 Can you stay for some tea? It's been so long. We have

 some catching up to do. Yes. Yes, we do. I know how

 painful this must be for you. It isn't easy for me either,

 considering Andrew's role in it. - And why have you told me

 this? - Because I thought you'd wanna know. Why? So you could

 do something. Do you think I'm an idiot? That I know nothing

 about the man I've lived with for 27 years? I've always assumed

 Howard had some outlet. A friend tucked away somewhere. I didn't know.

 I didn't care to know. But thank you for painting so vivid,

 so indelible a picture of my husband's activities. I'm sorry. I just

 felt that if it were me, I... - You'd want to know.

 - Yes. Absolutely. Then I owe you an apology. Because I've been

 sitting on a little secret about your family. - Oh? - Actually,

 it's not much of a secret. It's common knowledge among the cheerleaders.

 What is? The fact that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher.

 But where are my manners? I should have brought some biscuits with

 that. [umpire] Batter up. Well, aren't we just the parents of the

 year? Rooting for our son to fail so we can weasel out

 of a bribery scandal. Two bribery scandals. Gotta count the batting helmets.

 Strike one. For what it's worth, I don't think you're a quitter.

 Good. - And you don't resent me? - No. [umpire] Ball one.

 - OK, well, maybe a little. - Why? You get to chase

 your dream while I get to spend my life in advertising. Strike

 two. Maybe I'd like to write a book or, you know, start

 my own magazine. Then I think, \"I can't. I have a family

 to support.\" And I am OK with that... most of the time.

 You know what? I'm gonna look into that job at Burnham Fox.

 Don't you dare. You are gonna chase your dream and I am

 gonna support you 99%% of the time. - That's all I could

 really ask for. - [gasping] [cheering] How the hell did he do

 that? - [cheering] - Crap, they're cheering for him. Oh, jeez. He's

 never gonna quit now. What are we gonna say to him? -

 Ow! - [crowd gasping] Ow! Ow! I don't know, buddy. It looks

 like a pretty bad sprain. Probably gonna be out the rest of

 the season. Damn. Hey, but you know what? That was one heck

 of a hit. Sure was. [buzzer sounding] Posted your bail. We can

 go. - [sighs] Gabby... - Don't talk to me. Oh, lighten up.

 You were in there for maybe an hour. The whole thing is

 funny and you know it. Come on, Gabby. We've been going at

 each other for months now. Can we just stop? You know we're

 gonna end up back together. Wow. You are crazy. What's crazy is

 throwing away the past three years. Why can't we just say what

 we really feel for a change? Fine. I'll get the ball rolling.

 I still love you. That's too bad. I don't love you. Yeah,

 right. I don't. And I haven't for a very long time. That's

 a lie. You're just saying that to hurt me. No. If I

 wanted to hurt you I would tell you about last weekend, when

 I slept with John Rowland. [Gaby] Carlos, what are you doing? Carlos!

 Carlos! You can't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere.

 [screaming] [Bree] Danielle, he is your history teacher and he is 35

 years old. - Robert says age is just a number. - Don't

 you dare leave. You can't break us up. I love him and

 he loves me. Come on, Mom. I am so tired of feeling

 like the worst mother who ever lived. You're not. There's Grandma. I've

 tried so hard to set a good example. I've done the best

 I could to teach you kids right from wrong. Why isn't it

 taking? It took. I mean, we know the difference between right from

 wrong. We just chose wrong. Why? Sometimes when you push a kid

 really hard to go one way, the other way starts to look

 more entertaining. You're awful. I know. I blame shoddy parenting. [exhales] You

 know, we never discussed what it was like for you while you

 were away. I just want you to know, if you ever wanna

 talk about it, there's nothing you can't tell me. Um... Thanks. Not

 right now, OK? I'll pick up my bags later. - It's not

 my fault you weren't there. - What? It's not. I know what

 you're feeling, but... How could you possibly know? For six months I

 have prayed every day for that man to wake up. - And

 you made me give up on him. - I did not make

 you. Not on purpose. You were sweet, charming and English. So when

 my prayers were answered, I was naked in someone else's arms. -

 This should never have happened. - You can say what you want.

 Say that you feel guilty. Say that it was bad timing. But

 don't you say that this should never have happened. Because you're the

 best thing that's happened to me in years. Ian, I'm sorry. I

 know how you feel. It's Mike. It's my Mike. Then... Then you

 should go. Thank you. Oh, my God. You are awake. - Hi,

 Susan. - Oh, God. It's so wonderful to hear your voice again.

 - They say you've been here a lot. - Yes. Yes, I

 have. Almost every day. I can't tell you how much I'm kicking

 myself for not being here when you woke up. Where were you?

 I was in the country. But I'm back now. OK. Something wrong?

 You don't seem happy to see me. To be honest, I don't

 remember you. What? I remember moving to Fairview and meeting people. After

 that, nothing. The doctors say it's the head trauma. Oh. But you're

 gonna be all right. I'm gonna help you remember. If you don't

 mind, I'm kind of tired now. Oh. OK. God... Right, you, um...

 You sleep. I'll come back tomorrow. I'd rather you didn't. Well, I've

 got therapy. Maybe next week. OK. [Mary Alice] We all have our

 reasons for rewriting history. Sometimes we need to provide ourselves alibis. Drama

 camp was awesome. We're talking zero supervision. Sometimes we wanna hurt someone

 who has hurt us. So you can tell Carlos that he can

 have the photo albums. She says that they hold no sentimental value

 for her. And then there are times we just wanna spare ourselves

 embarrassment. I don't know how these rumors start. Parker only quit the

 team 'cause he hurt his ankle. Of course, there are some who

 feel that to rewrite history is just another way to lie. And

 poor Howard has to work late again tonight. Of course, he does

 it all for the family. But what is history anyway... You say

 I dated Susan for a long time. Do you think I was

 in love with her? ... but a set of lies, agreed upon?
